<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
        <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
        <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
        <artifactId>groupdocs-conversion</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition
To unlock the full potential of GroupDocs.Conversion, you'll need a valid license:
- **Free Trial**: Download from [GroupDocs Free Trial](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/) to test features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license via [Temporary License Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: Acquire a full license for extended use at the [GroupDocs Purchase Page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
Once you have your license file, initialize and set it up in your project as demonstrated below.

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll focus on implementing the "Set License from File" feature using GroupDocs.Conversion for Java. This functionality is crucial for authenticating your library usage and unlocking all its capabilities.

### Set License from File Feature
This feature allows you to authenticate your GroupDocs license by specifying a file path where the license file resides.

#### Step 1: Define the License Path
Start by defining the path to your license file:
```java
String licenseFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/LicensePath";
```

#### Step 2: Check License File Existence
Ensure that the specified license file exists at the provided path:
```java
File file = new File(licenseFilePath);
if (file.exists()) {
    // Proceed with setting the license
} else {
    System.out.println("License file not found.");
}
```

#### Step 3: Set the License
Create an instance of `License` and set it using the file path:
```java
License license = new License();
license.setLicense(licenseFilePath);
System.out.println("License successfully applied!");
```

### Parameters and Methods
- **setLicense(String licensePath)**: This method takes a string parameter representing the path to your license file. It is essential for applying the license.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your `licenseFilePath` is correct and accessible.
- Check for permission issues if you encounter access errors.
