## Prerequisites

Before implementing this feature, ensure that you have:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
2. **Maven:** For dependency management and project setup.
3. Basic understanding of Java programming.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for Java

To begin using GroupDocs.Conversion, you need to set up your environment properly. Here's how you can do it with Maven:

**Maven Configuration**

Add the following repository and dependency configurations in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-conversion</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**License Acquisition**
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore the library's features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, purchase a full license.

### Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up your environment, let’s add a watermark during document conversion.

#### 1. Initialize Converter Object

Firstly, initialize the `Converter` object with your input file:

```java
String inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath);
```

This line creates a `Converter` instance that loads your DOCX document.

#### 2. Set Up PDF Conversion Options

Configure the conversion options to specify how you want the output PDF to look:

```java
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

#### 3. Create and Configure Watermark Text Options

Define the watermark text, its appearance, and properties using `WatermarkTextOptions`:

```java
WatermarkTextOptions watermark = new WatermarkTextOptions("Sample watermark");
watermark.setColor(Color.red); // Set the color of the watermark
watermark.setWidth(100);       // Define the width
watermark.setHeight(100);      // Define the height
watermark.setBackground(true); // Place it in the background
```

Here, we set up a red watermark with specified dimensions and position it as a background element.

#### 4. Apply Watermark to Conversion Options

Integrate your watermark settings into the conversion options:

```java
options.setWatermark(watermark);
```

This step ensures that your configured watermark is included during the conversion process.

#### 5. Perform the Conversion

Finally, execute the conversion with the specified options:

```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/AddWatermark.pdf";
converter.convert(outputFilePath, options);
```

This line converts your DOCX file to a PDF and applies the watermark as defined.

### Practical Applications

Adding watermarks can be useful in various scenarios such as:
- **Branding:** Adding company logos or names to documents.
- **Security:** Marking documents as "Confidential" during sharing.
- **Copyright Protection:** Protecting intellectual property by embedding ownership information.
  
This feature can also integrate with automated document handling systems, enhancing security and branding in batch processes.

### Performance Considerations

When converting large volumes of documents:
- Optimize memory usage by managing Java's garbage collection settings.
- Use efficient I/O operations to handle file reads/writes.
- Follow best practices for resource management in your Java applications.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ve successfully added a watermark during document conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion for Java. This feature is a powerful tool for enhancing document security and branding.
