## Implementation Guide

Let’s break down the process into manageable steps. We’ll focus on converting specific pages from a document to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for Java.

### Initialize Converter Object

To begin, create an instance of the `Converter` class with your source document:

```java
Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.docx");
```

This code snippet initializes the conversion process by loading the document you wish to convert.

### Configure PDF Conversion Options

Next, specify which pages you want to convert using `PdfConvertOptions`. This allows selective page conversion rather than converting the entire document:

```java
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
options.setPages(Arrays.asList(2, 3)); // Convert only pages 2 and 3
```

Here, we set up our options to convert just pages two and three of the document.

### Perform Conversion

Finally, execute the conversion with your defined settings:

```java
converter.convert("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertedSpecificPages.pdf\
