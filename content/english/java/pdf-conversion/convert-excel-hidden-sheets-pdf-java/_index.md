## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for Java

To get started, set up GroupDocs.Conversion in your Java project using Maven. This setup involves adding the necessary repository and dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

**Maven Setup:**

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>repository.groupdocs.com</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-conversion</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition:
To use GroupDocs.Conversion, you can start with a free trial to evaluate its features. For continued usage, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing the full version from [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup:
1. **Import Required Packages:**
   Make sure to import necessary classes for conversion.
2. **Create Converter Instance:**
   Initialize with your source document path and load options.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up GroupDocs.Conversion, let's implement the feature to convert Excel spreadsheets, including hidden sheets, into PDFs.

### Feature Overview
This feature allows you to include all sheets from an Excel file in a PDF output, even those hidden during normal usage. This is especially useful for comprehensive reporting and documentation purposes where every detail matters.

#### Step 1: Define Source Document Path
Specify the path of your source spreadsheet containing hidden sheets.

```java
String sourceDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX_WITH_HIDDEN_SHEET";
```

#### Step 2: Configure Load Options
Here, you set up load options to ensure hidden sheets are included:

```java
SpreadsheetsLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetsLoadOptions();
loadOptions.setShowHiddenSheets(true); // Include hidden sheets
loadOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);   // One page per sheet in PDF output
```

#### Step 3: Initialize the Converter
Create a converter instance with your specified source document and load options.

```java
Converter converter = new Converter(sourceDocumentPath, () -> loadOptions);
```

#### Step 4: Set Up Conversion Options
Configure the conversion settings for outputting to PDF:

```java
PdfConvertOptions convertOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 5: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the result at your desired location.

```java
String outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertSpreadsheetWithHiddenSheetsIncluded.pdf";
converter.convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
```

### Key Configuration Options:
- `setShowHiddenSheets(true)`: Ensures hidden sheets are processed.
- `setOnePagePerSheet(true)`: Converts each sheet into a separate PDF page.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the source file path is correctly specified to avoid file-not-found errors.
- Check for correct versioning in your Maven setup if you encounter dependency issues.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where converting Excel files with hidden sheets proves beneficial:
1. **Financial Reporting**: Including all data from spreadsheets, even the hidden details, ensures comprehensive reports.
2. **Data Audits**: Converting entire datasets for archival purposes without omitting any hidden information.
3. **Project Documentation**: Maintaining complete documentation by including every sheet in your PDF outputs.

## Performance Considerations
When working with large Excel files or numerous sheets, consider these tips:
- Optimize memory usage by managing resources effectively in Java.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large datasets.
- Regularly monitor application performance and make adjustments as necessary.
