Familiarity with Java programming and basic knowledge of Maven dependency management are beneficial but not mandatory.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for Java

To start using the GroupDocs.Conversion library, add it as a dependency in your project. Here's how you can do this using Maven:

```xml
<repositories>
   <repository>
      <id>groupdocs-repo</id>
      <name>GroupDocs Repository</name>
      <url>https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/java/</url>
   </repository>
</repositories>

   <dependency>
      <groupId>com.groupdocs</groupId>
      <artifactId>groupdocs-conversion</artifactId>
      <version>25.2</version>
   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Licensing
GroupDocs offers different licensing options, including a free trial to explore its features. You can acquire a temporary license or purchase one for full access.

### Initialization and Setup

Once you've added the dependency, initialize your conversion environment:

```java
import com.groupdocs.conversion.Converter;
import com.groupdocs.conversion.options.load.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

public class InitializeGroupDocs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("GroupDocs Conversion for Java Initialized.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading Options for Spreadsheet Documents

#### Overview
Setting advanced loading options allows you to tailor how your spreadsheet documents are handled during conversion. This includes showing grid lines and ensuring each sheet is converted as a separate page.

#### Implementing the Feature
Here's how you can configure these options:

```java
import com.groupdocs.conversion.options.load.SpreadsheetLoadOptions;

public class LoadSpreadsheetWithOptions {
    public static void run() {
        SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
        
        // Show grid lines in the converted document
        loadOptions.setShowGridLines(true);
        
        // Ensure each sheet is on a separate page
        loadOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
    }
}
```
- **SpreadsheetLoadOptions**: This class provides various configuration options for loading spreadsheets.
- **setShowGridLines(true)**: Enables grid lines in the output PDF.
- **setOnePagePerSheet(true)**: Converts each sheet into a separate page.

### Conversion of Spreadsheet Document to PDF

#### Overview
With your load options set, you can proceed to convert your spreadsheet document to a PDF file using specific conversion settings.

#### Implementing the Feature

```java
import com.groupdocs.conversion.Converter;
import com.groupdocs.conversion.options.convert.PdfConvertOptions;

public class ConvertSpreadsheetToPdf {
    public static void run(String inputFilePath, String outputFilePath) {
        SpreadsheetLoadOptions loadOptions = new SpreadsheetLoadOptions();
        loadOptions.setShowGridLines(true);
        loadOptions.setOnePagePerSheet(true);
        
        Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath, () -> loadOptions);
        PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
