        <artifactId>groupdocs-conversion</artifactId>
        <version>25.2</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers various licensing options:

- **Free Trial:** Test out the library's capabilities with a temporary license.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain this for extended evaluation purposes.
- **Purchase:** Opt for a full license if you decide to integrate it into your production environment.

### Basic Initialization

Once the setup is complete, create an instance of the `Converter` class with your target document:

```java
import com.groupdocs.conversion.Converter;

// Initialize the converter with your document path.
Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_DOCX");
```

## Implementation Guide: Converting a Range of Pages to PDF

### Overview

This feature allows you to specify which pages of a document should be converted into a PDF format, giving you control over the output content.

#### Step 1: Configure Conversion Options

To convert specific pages, set up `PdfConvertOptions` with your desired page range:

```java
import com.groupdocs.conversion.options.convert.PdfConvertOptions;

// Create an instance of PdfConvertOptions.
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();

// Set the starting page and total number of consecutive pages to convert.
options.setPageNumber(2);
options.setPagesCount(2);
```

#### Step 2: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion using the `convert` method, specifying the output file path:

```java
// Define where the converted PDF will be saved.
String convertedFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ConvertNConsecutivePages.pdf";

// Convert and save the document as a PDF with specified options.
converter.convert(convertedFile, options);
```

### Key Configuration Options

- **PageNumber:** Determines the starting page for conversion. Adjust this to fit your needs.
- **PagesCount:** Specifies how many consecutive pages should be converted from the start.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all paths are correctly set and accessible by your application.
- Verify that the document format is supported by GroupDocs.Conversion.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where selective page conversion can be beneficial:

1. **Legal Documentation:** Convert only relevant sections of a lengthy contract to share with clients or colleagues.
2. **Educational Materials:** Share specific chapters from textbooks without distributing entire volumes.
3. **Internal Reports:** Distribute summarized reports by extracting only the essential pages.

## Performance Considerations

- Utilize efficient memory management practices in Java to handle large documents smoothly.
- Limit the number of simultaneous conversions to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Conversion library for performance improvements and bug fixes.
