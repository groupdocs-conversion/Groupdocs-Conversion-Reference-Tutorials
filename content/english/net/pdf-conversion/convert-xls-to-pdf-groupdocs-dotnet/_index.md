- **Environment Setup**: Ensure your development environment supports .NET applications. This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of C# programming.
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Be familiar with handling files in .NET and understand the basics of document conversion.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start, install the GroupDocs.Conversion library into your project. Here are two methods to do this:

### NuGet Package Manager Console
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

### .NET CLI

Hereâ€™s how you can initialize and set up GroupDocs.Conversion in C#:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now that we have the setup ready, let's implement the feature of converting XLS files to PDF.

### Loading the Source File

Define paths for your input and output directories. Replace `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY'` and `'YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY'` with actual paths on your system:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Define the path for the source XLS file and the output PDF file
string xlsFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xls");
string pdfOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xls-converted-to.pdf");
```

### Performing the Conversion

To convert your Excel file to a PDF:
```csharp
try
{
    // Load the source XLS file
    using (var converter = new Converter(xlsFilePath))
    {
        // Set conversion options for PDF format
        var options = new PdfConvertOptions();

        // Perform conversion and save the output PDF file
        converter.Convert(pdfOutputFile, options);
    }
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

#### Explanation

- **Converter Class**: Responsible for loading your document.
- **PdfConvertOptions**: Specifies that we want to convert our document into a PDF format.
- **Error Handling**: The try-catch block ensures any issues during conversion are caught and logged.

### Troubleshooting Tips
