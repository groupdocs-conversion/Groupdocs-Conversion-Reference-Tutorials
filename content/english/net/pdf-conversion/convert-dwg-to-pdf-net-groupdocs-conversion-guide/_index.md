using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Initialize the Converter with a DWG document path
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.dwg");
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Set up options for PDF conversion and convert the file
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dwg-converted-to.pdf");
    
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down each step to ensure you can successfully convert DWG files to PDF.

### Feature: Convert DWG to PDF

Converting a DWG file into a PDF document is straightforward with GroupDocs.Conversion. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Load the Source DWG File
Load your DWG file using the `Converter` class, specifying the path to your source file.

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.dwg");
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Continue with conversion steps...
}
```

*Why?* Loading the DWG file initializes the `Converter` object, preparing it for processing.

#### Step 2: Set Up PDF Conversion Options
Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`, which holds configurations for your output PDF.

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

*Why?* Customizing these options allows you to control the output, such as page size and orientation.

#### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output
Use the `Convert` method to perform the conversion and save the result in PDF format.

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dwg-converted-to.pdf");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

*Why?* This step executes the conversion using the specified settings, generating a PDF file.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue:** File not found error. Ensure the paths to your source and output directories are correct.
- **Solution:** Double-check directory names and ensure they exist on your filesystem.

## Practical Applications

Converting DWG files to PDFs has numerous practical applications:

1. **Archiving Designs:** Easily store project designs in a universally accessible format.
2. **Client Sharing:** Simplify sharing with clients who may not have CAD software.
3. **Documentation:** Include drawings in reports or presentations without compatibility issues.

Integrating GroupDocs.Conversion into other .NET systems can enhance document management workflows, making it an invaluable tool for projects requiring extensive file handling.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Monitor memory usage during conversions to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Best Practices:** Dispose of `Converter` objects properly after use to free resources promptly.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain efficient and responsive applications.
