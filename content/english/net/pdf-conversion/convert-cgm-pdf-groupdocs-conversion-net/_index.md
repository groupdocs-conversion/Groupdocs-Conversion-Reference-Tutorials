## Implementation Guide
### Convert CGM File to PDF
Converting CGM files to PDF allows you to maintain the integrity of your graphics while making them more portable and easier to share. This section will guide you through this conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion.
#### Step 1: Load the Input File
Load your CGM file into the converter:
```csharp
// Load the input CGM file
var inputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your-input-file.cgm");
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Proceed with conversion steps...
}
```
*Explanation*: This step initializes the conversion process by loading your specific CGM file.
#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Set up the PDF conversion options:
```csharp
// Create conversion options for PDF format
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
*Explanation*: Here, we define how the conversion should be handled, specifying the output as a PDF.
#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the file conversion and save it to your desired location:
```csharp
// Convert and save the CGM file as a PDF
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output-file.pdf");
converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
```
*Explanation*: This command converts the loaded CGM file into a PDF using the specified options and saves it to your output directory.
