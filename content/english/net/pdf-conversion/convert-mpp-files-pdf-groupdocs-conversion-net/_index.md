# Convert MPP Files to PDF with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Converting files from one format to another is a common task today, especially when you need to share or archive data in universally accessible formats. If you're dealing with Microsoft Project files (.MPP) and want to convert them into PDFs, the process can seem complex—unless you have the right tools. Thankfully, **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** simplifies this task significantly.

In this guide, I'll walk you through how to effectively convert MPP files to PDFs using the GroupDocs.Conversion library in your C# applications. Whether you're new to this or have some experience, you'll find this tutorial straightforward, with clear step-by-step instructions and practical tips.


## Prerequisites

Before diving into code, there are a few things you'll need to set up:

### 1. Visual Studio IDE

An IDE like Visual Studio (Community Edition is free and sufficient) is ideal for developing .NET applications. Make sure you've installed it.

### 2. .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+ SDK

Ensure your project targets a compatible framework—most modern versions work seamlessly.

### 3. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library

Download and install the GroupDocs.Conversion library:

- **Via NuGet Package Manager:**  
  Open your project in Visual Studio, navigate to **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages**, then search for `GroupDocs.Conversion` and install it.

- **Via direct download:**  
  From [GroupDocs Downloads](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/), grab the latest version and add it to your project references.

### 4. License (Optional but Recommended)

While a trial version is available, for full-featured or production use, you may need a license. You can get a free trial or purchase here: [GroupDocs License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).


## Import Packages

Start your code by importing the necessary namespaces so you have access to all conversion functionalities:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

This setup ensures your project recognizes GroupDocs' classes and methods.


## Step-by-Step Guide to Convert MPP to PDF

Now, let's walk through the process step-by-step. Each step will be elaborate enough to help you understand the underlying mechanisms and how to modify the code for your own needs.


### Step 1: Set Up Your Input & Output Paths

First, define where your source MPP file resides, and where you want to save the converted PDF:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"C:\Files\SampleProject.mpp"; // Your MPP file path
string outputFolder = @"C:\ConvertedFiles\"; // Directory for converted files
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ConvertedProject.pdf");
```

Make sure your output folder exists. If not, you'll need to create it programmatically:

```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
}
```

### Step 2: Load Your Source MPP File

The cornerstone of this process is initializing the `Converter` object with your source MPP file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion options will be set here
}
```

This loads your file into GroupDocs for processing.

### Step 3: Choose and Configure Conversion Options

For converting to PDF, you'll need to specify `PdfConvertOptions`. Customize options if needed (e.g., page size, quality):

```csharp
var convertOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

You can modify options like:

```csharp
// For example, to set specific page ranges or quality:
convertOptions.PageNumber = 1; // Convert only the first page
convertOptions.PageCount = 10; // Or convert only first ten pages
```

But for a straightforward full-file conversion, defaults are often sufficient.

### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

This is the core step where the magic happens. Call the `Convert` method, passing in the output path and options:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
Console.WriteLine($"Conversion completed successfully! Saved at: {outputFilePath}");
```

That's it! Your MPP file is now turned into a ready-to-view PDF.

### Step 5: Handle Exceptions & Clean Up

Always include exception handling to account for runtime errors:

```csharp
try
{
    using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
    {
        var convertOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
        converter.Convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
        Console.WriteLine($"Conversion completed successfully! Saved at: {outputFilePath}");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

This ensures your program doesn't crash unexpectedly and provides useful feedback.


## BONUS: Automating Batch Conversion of Multiple MPP Files

You might want to convert multiple MPP files at once. Here's a quick concept:

```csharp
string[] mppFiles = Directory.GetFiles(@"C:\MPP_Files\", "*.mpp");

foreach (var mppFile in mppFiles)
{
    string fileNameWithoutExtension = Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(mppFile);
    string outputPath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, fileNameWithoutExtension + ".pdf");

    using (var converter = new Converter(mppFile))
    {
        var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
        converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
        Console.WriteLine($"Converted {mppFile} to {outputPath}");
    }
}
```

That way, you can streamline multiple conversions easily.


## Conclusion

Converting MPP files into PDFs using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is a straightforward process once you understand the steps. From setting up your environment to configuring options and executing conversions, this library makes the task intuitive and efficient. Whether you're building a report automation system, integrating with enterprise workflows, or just automating your daily tasks, this method offers a reliable and high-quality solution.

Happy coding! If you have questions or need assistance tailoring this process, feel free to ask.
