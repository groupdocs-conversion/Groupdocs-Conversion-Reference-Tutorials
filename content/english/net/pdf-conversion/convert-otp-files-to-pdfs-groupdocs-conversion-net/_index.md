namespace ConvertOTPToPDF
{
    class Program
    {

    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation process into logical steps to convert your OTP files to PDFs.

### Load and Configure Your Document
Firstly, load your OTP file using the `Converter` class. This acts as the foundation for all conversion operations:

```csharp
// Define paths
string sourceFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.otp";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Initialize Converter with the OTP file path
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Configure PDF conversion options
    var pdfOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();

    // Output file path setup
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "otp-converted-to.pdf");

    // Convert and save the document as PDF
    converter.Convert(outputFile, pdfOptions);
}
```

#### Explanation of Key Parameters
- **Converter Class**: Represents the source file. It requires a valid OTP file path.
- **PdfConvertOptions**: Configures how the conversion should be executed. You can adjust settings like page numbers and zoom levels.
- **converter.Convert()**: The method that performs the actual file conversion.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **File Not Found Error**: Ensure your source file path is correct.
- **Permission Denied**: Check if your application has write access to the output directory.
- **Conversion Fails**: Validate that your GroupDocs.Conversion version matches the required dependencies.
