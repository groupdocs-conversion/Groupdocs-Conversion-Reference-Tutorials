## Introduction

In today's digital world, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is paramount. Whether you're dealing with documents, spreadsheets, or presentations, having the right tools can make all the difference. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is one such tool that empowers developers to effortlessly convert various file formats using simple and efficient methods. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to convert OTT files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Ensure you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. If you haven't already installed it, you can download the library from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided.

## Import Namespaces

Before you start coding, make sure to include the required namespaces in your project. This allows you to access the classes and methods provided by GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET seamlessly.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```


Now that we have the prerequisites covered, let's break down the process of converting OTT to PDF into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set Output Folder and File Path

```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ott-converted-to.pdf");
```

In this step, we define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path where you want to save the converted file.

## Step 2: Load the Source OTT File

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_OTT))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

Here, we create a new instance of the `Converter` class provided by GroupDocs.Conversion, passing the path of the source OTT file as a parameter (`Constants.SAMPLE_OTT` represents the path to the OTT file).

## Step 3: Set Conversion Options

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

In this step, we create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` class to specify any additional conversion options. This allows customization of the conversion process according to specific requirements.

## Step 4: Convert OTT to PDF

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

Finally, we call the `Convert` method on the converter instance, passing the output file path and conversion options as parameters. This initiates the conversion process from OTT to PDF format.

## Step 5: Display Conversion Status

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

After the conversion is completed, we display a success message along with the directory where the converted PDF file is saved.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET provides a simple yet powerful solution for converting OTT files to PDF format effortlessly. By following the step-by-step guide outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate file conversion functionality into your .NET applications with ease.
