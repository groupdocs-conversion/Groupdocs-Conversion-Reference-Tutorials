## Implementation Guide
### Convert PPT to PDF Feature
The primary functionality of GroupDocs.Conversion is its ability to transform PPT files into PDFs. Let's break down the process:
#### Step 1: Load Your Presentation File
Create a new instance of the Converter class by providing it with the path to your PPT file.
#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Use `PdfConvertOptions` to specify any particular settings for the conversion, like starting page or password protection if needed.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
// Customize options as necessary
```
#### Step 3: Execute Conversion
Invoke the `Convert` method on your Converter instance, passing in the desired output path and conversion options. This step handles all processing and saves your PDF file.
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File not found error.
  - **Solution**: Verify that paths are correctly set and accessible.
- **Error During Conversion**:
  - **Check**: Ensure input PPT files are not corrupted.
