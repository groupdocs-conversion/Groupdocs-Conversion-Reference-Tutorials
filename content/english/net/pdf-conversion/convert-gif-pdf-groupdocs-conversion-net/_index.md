## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the process of converting GIFs to PDFs using GroupDocs.Conversion.

### Feature: Convert GIF to PDF
This feature transforms a GIF image into a universally accessible PDF document. Hereâ€™s how you can implement it:

#### Step 1: Load Your Source File
First, load your source GIF file. You'll need the path to your GIF and an output directory for the PDF.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

namespace ConversionFeatures {
    public static class GifToPdfConverter {
        public static void ConvertGifToPdf() {
            string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "gif-converted-to.pdf");
            
            // Load the source GIF file
            using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.gif")) {
                var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
                converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Parameters and Methods
- `Converter`: Initializes the conversion process. Pass it the path to your GIF file.
- `PdfConvertOptions`: Configures how the PDF should be generated.
- `converter.Convert()`: Executes the conversion from GIF to PDF.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correct and directories exist.
- Handle exceptions to catch any issues during conversion, like missing files or permissions errors.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Archiving**: Convert marketing materials from GIFs to PDFs for easy distribution.
2. **Digital Signatures**: Use converted PDFs in systems requiring signed documents.
3. **Reporting Tools**: Integrate into reporting frameworks that require standardized document formats.

## Performance Considerations
- **Optimize Image Sizes**: Reduce the resolution of your GIF before conversion if file size is a concern.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Dispose of objects properly to free up memory in .NET applications.
