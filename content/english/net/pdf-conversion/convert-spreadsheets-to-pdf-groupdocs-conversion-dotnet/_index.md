## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore two main features of converting spreadsheets to PDFs using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: applying advanced options and configuring load settings.

### Convert Spreadsheet to PDF with Advanced Options

**Overview:** This feature allows you to convert a spreadsheet document (e.g., XLSX) into a PDF file while utilizing advanced loading options. You can skip empty rows/columns and configure each sheet to be converted into a single PDF page.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Define Output Directory**
   Set up your output directory path using placeholders for flexibility:
   
   ```csharp
   string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pdf");
   ```

2. **Configure Load Options**
   Customize load options to skip empty rows/columns and convert each sheet into a single PDF page:
   
   ```csharp
   Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> getLoadOptions = loadContext => new SpreadsheetLoadOptions
   {
       SkipEmptyRowsAndColumns = true,
       OnePagePerSheet = true
   };
   ```

3. **Initialize Converter**
   Set up the converter with your input file and configured load options:
   
   ```csharp
   string inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/sample.xlsx";
   using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile, getLoadOptions))
   {
       PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
       converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
   }
   ```

### Configurable Load Options for Spreadsheet Conversion

**Overview:** This feature lets you define and customize load options before conversion. It’s useful for scenarios where preprocessing the spreadsheet can enhance the final output.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:
1. **Define Custom Load Options**
   Create a method to configure your desired load settings:
   
   ```csharp
   public static Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> GetLoadOptions()
   {
       return loadContext => new SpreadsheetLoadOptions
       {
           SkipEmptyRowsAndColumns = true,
           OnePagePerSheet = true
       };
   }
   ```

2. **Utilize Custom Load Options**
   Use these configurable options in your conversion process:
   
   ```csharp
   Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> loadOptions = GetLoadOptions();
   string inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY" + "/sample.xlsx";
   using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile, loadOptions))
   {
       PdfConvertOptions pdfOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
       converter.Convert(outputFile, pdfOptions);
   }
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the input file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that all necessary permissions are set for reading/writing files.
- Check if GroupDocs.Conversion package version matches your project setup.
