# Convert ONE to PDF

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of converting a ONE file to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. Follow the steps below to achieve this conversion seamlessly.

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the conversion process, make sure you import the necessary namespaces to your .NET project. These namespaces are essential for accessing the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Conversion.

1. Open Your .NET Project: Open your .NET project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.

2. Add Namespace: Add the following namespaces at the top of your code file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the conversion, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Make sure you have downloaded and installed GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. If you haven't done so yet, you can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).

2. ONE File: You need the ONE file that you want to convert to PDF. Ensure you have the path to the source ONE file ready.

Now that you have imported the necessary namespaces and ensured you have the prerequisites, let's proceed with the conversion process.

## Step 1: Load the Source ONE File

The first step is to load the source ONE file using GroupDocs.Conversion. This step involves specifying the path to your ONE file.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path_to_your_ONE_file.one"))
```

Replace `"Path_to_your_ONE_file.one"` with the actual path to your ONE file.

## Step 2: Specify Conversion Options

Next, you need to specify the conversion options. In this case, we are converting to PDF format, so we'll use `PdfConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

You can customize conversion options according to your requirements.

## Step 3: Convert to PDF

Now, it's time to perform the conversion. Call the `Convert` method of the converter object and pass the output file path along with the conversion options.

```csharp
converter.Convert("Path_to_output_PDF_file.pdf", options);
```

Replace `"Path_to_output_PDF_file.pdf"` with the desired path where you want to save the converted PDF file.

## Step 4: Check Conversion Completion

After the conversion process is complete, you can verify its success by checking the output folder.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

This line will print the completion message along with the output folder where the converted PDF file is saved.
