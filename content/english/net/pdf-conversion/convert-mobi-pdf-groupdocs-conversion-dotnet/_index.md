## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll go through each step of converting a MOBI file to a PDF.

### Overview: Converting MOBI to PDF
This feature leverages GroupDocs.Conversion's powerful library to transform your MOBI files into accessible PDF documents. Here’s how it works:

#### Step 1: Setup Paths and Initialize Converter
First, define the paths for your input and output files. This helps in organizing file management within your project.

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";

string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mobi");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mobi-converted-to.pdf");

using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion steps will follow here
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure PDF Options
Set up your conversion options. Customize the output PDF's properties as needed.

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
// Add more configurations if needed, such as page margins or bookmarks.
```

#### Step 3: Execute Conversion
Finally, execute the conversion and save the output file.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Key Configuration Options
