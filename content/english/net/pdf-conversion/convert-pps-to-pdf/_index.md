## Introduction
In today's digital world, the ability to manipulate and convert files is crucial. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is a powerful tool that allows developers to seamlessly convert various document formats with ease. In this tutorial, we'll focus on converting PPS (PowerPoint Slide Show) files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of converting PPS to PDF effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Ensure that you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Obtain a Temporary License (Optional)
While GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be used without a license in trial mode, obtaining a temporary license is recommended for production use. You can acquire a temporary license from [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have a development environment set up with Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE installed.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

Now that we have everything set up, let's break down the conversion process into simple steps:
## Step 1: Specify Output Directory and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pps-converted-to.pdf");
```
In this step, we define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Make sure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path.
## Step 2: Load the Source PPS File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_PPS))
```
Here, we create a new instance of the `Converter` class and pass the path of the source PPS file to its constructor.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
In this step, we create an instance of the `PdfConvertOptions` class. This class provides various options for customizing the conversion process. For example, you can set page size, margins, image quality, and more.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Finally, we call the `Convert` method of the `Converter` class, passing the output file path and conversion options as parameters. This initiates the conversion process, converting the PPS file to PDF format.
## Step 5: Verify Conversion Completion
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
After the conversion is complete, this step displays a success message along with the path where the converted PDF file is saved.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to convert PPS files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and ensuring that you have the necessary prerequisites in place, you can seamlessly integrate document conversion capabilities into your .NET applications.
