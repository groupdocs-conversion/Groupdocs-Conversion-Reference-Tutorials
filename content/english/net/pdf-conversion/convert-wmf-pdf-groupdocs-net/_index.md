        {
            // Initialize the converter with a sample WMF file path
            using (var converter = new Converter("your-file.wmf"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Initialized successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now that our environment is set up, let's convert WMF files to PDF step-by-step.

### Convert WMF to PDF (Feature Overview)
This section guides you through converting a WMF file into a high-quality PDF document using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Ensure Output Directory Exists
Start by specifying your document storage and output paths:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputPath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!Directory.Exists(outputPath))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputPath);
}
```
#### Step 2: Load and Convert WMF File
Load your WMF file and set up conversion options:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "your-file.wmf");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputPath, "wmf-converted-to.pdf");

using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
This process converts your WMF file to PDF using the specified settings.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** Ensure all directories exist or are correctly specified if you encounter file path errors.
- **Performance:** Optimize memory management by disposing of objects promptly after use, especially for large files.

With these steps, your WMF file should now be successfully converted into a PDF!
