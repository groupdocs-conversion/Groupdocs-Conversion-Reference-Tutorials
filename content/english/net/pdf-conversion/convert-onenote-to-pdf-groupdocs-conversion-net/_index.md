### Loading and Converting a .one File to PDF

#### Overview
This section focuses on how to load your OneNote file and convert it to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

##### Step 1: Define Paths

Start by defining the paths for your source `.one` file and the target PDF output:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Specify the path to your OneNote file and the resulting PDF.
string oneFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.one");
string pdfOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "one-converted-to.pdf");
```

##### Step 2: Load the Source ONE File

Load your `.one` file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(oneFilePath))
{
    // Proceed to specify conversion options.
}
```

##### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options for PDF Format

Set up the PDF conversion options:

```csharp
var pdfOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

##### Step 4: Convert and Save the .one File as a PDF Document

Perform the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(pdfOutputFile, pdfOptions);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

#### Key Configuration Options
- **PdfConvertOptions**: Customize page ranges, rotation, and other settings to tailor your output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
