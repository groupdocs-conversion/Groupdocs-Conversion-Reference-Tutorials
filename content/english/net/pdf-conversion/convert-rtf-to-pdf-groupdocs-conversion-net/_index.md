string rtfFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.rtf");
string pdfOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "rtf-converted-to.pdf");

using (var converter = new Converter(rtfFilePath))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(pdfOutputPath, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert RTF to PDF

This feature allows you to transform RTF documents into PDFs using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories
Define paths for your document and output directories. This helps organize input and output files efficiently.
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Define File Paths
Specify the source RTF file path and the destination PDF file path.
```csharp
string rtfFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.rtf");
string pdfOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "rtf-converted-to.pdf");
```

#### Step 3: Load and Convert Document
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your RTF document and convert it into a PDF format.
