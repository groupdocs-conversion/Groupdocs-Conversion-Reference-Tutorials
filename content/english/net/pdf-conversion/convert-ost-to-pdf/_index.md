GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET provides a powerful solution for developers seeking to integrate file conversion capabilities into their .NET applications seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into how to convert OST (Outlook Offline Storage Table) files to PDF (Portable Document Format) using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Firstly, you need to download and install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. You can get the necessary files from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment
Ensure that you have a development environment set up for .NET development. This includes having Visual Studio installed on your machine.
### 3. Source OST File
You should have the OST file that you want to convert to PDF ready and accessible.

## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Conversion functionalities.

Include the required `using` directives at the top of your C# file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;
```

Now, let's break down the provided code snippet into multiple steps for a comprehensive understanding:
## 1. Define Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ost-converted-{0}-to.pdf");
```
Here, you specify the directory where the converted PDF file will be saved and define the file name pattern for the converted files.
## 2. Load the Source OST File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_OST, fileType => fileType == EmailFileType.Ost
																									? new PersonalStorageLoadOptions()
																									: null))
```
Create an instance of the `Converter` class and specify the source OST file to be converted. Additionally, provide load options specifically for OST files using `PersonalStorageLoadOptions`.
## 3. Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` to configure options for the PDF conversion.
## 4. Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(
	(FileType fileType) => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFile, counter++), FileMode.Create),
	options
);
```
Initiate the conversion process by calling the `Convert` method on the `Converter` instance. Provide a function to handle the creation of output file streams.
## 5. Display Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and indicate the location where the converted PDF files can be found.
