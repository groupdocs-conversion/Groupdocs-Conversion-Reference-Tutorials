## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to convert a spreadsheet to PDF using advanced options:

### Convert Spreadsheet to PDF with Advanced Options

#### Overview

Convert an Excel file into a PDF while displaying grid lines and ensuring each sheet appears on one page in the output document.

#### Step 1: Define Load Options

Configure load options for advanced settings:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> getLoadOptions = loadContext => new SpreadsheetLoadOptions
{
    ShowGridLines = true,
    OnePagePerSheet = true
};
```

**Explanation**: `SpreadsheetLoadOptions` lets you configure how the spreadsheet is loaded. Setting `ShowGridLines` to `true` includes grid lines in your PDF, and `OnePagePerSheet` ensures each sheet fits on a single page.

#### Step 2: Convert Using the Converter Class

Use the `Converter` class to perform the conversion:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string inputFilePath = "sample.xlsx";
string outputFolder = "output";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pdf");

// Initialize Converter with load options
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath, getLoadOptions))
{
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions(); // Set up PDF conversion options
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Perform the conversion
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Converter` class takes in your Excel file path and load options. The `PdfConvertOptions` class specifies any additional settings for the PDF output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your input file path is correct.
- Check if the GroupDocs.Conversion library version matches with your project's .NET framework version.
- Make sure you have write permissions for the output directory.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion offers a wide range of practical applications, including:
1. **Document Management Systems**: Automate document format conversions within enterprise systems.
2. **Report Generation**: Convert financial and statistical reports from spreadsheets to PDFs for standardized distribution.
3. **Integration with Other .NET Systems**: Seamlessly integrate conversion capabilities into existing .NET applications or frameworks like ASP.NET.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- Use the latest version of the library to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of `Converter` objects properly after use.
- For large files, consider processing them in chunks if applicable.
