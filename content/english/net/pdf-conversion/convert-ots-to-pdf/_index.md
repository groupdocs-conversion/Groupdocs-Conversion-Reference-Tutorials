By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate document conversion functionality into your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on the journey of converting OTS to PDF, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

2. Development Environment: Have a suitable development environment set up, such as Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE for .NET development.
3. Sample OTS File: Obtain a sample OTS file that you intend to convert. If you don't have one, you can use any OTS file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the conversion process, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your .NET project. These namespaces are essential for utilizing the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path and File Name
Begin by specifying the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved, along with the desired file name.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ots-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source OTS File
Using the GroupDocs.Conversion library, load the source OTS file that you wish to convert.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_OTS))
{
    // Conversion code will be placed here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_OTS` with the path to your actual OTS file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Specify any additional options or configurations for the conversion process. In this case, since we're converting to PDF, we'll use `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
You can customize conversion options according to your requirements.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the resulting PDF file using the specified options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This line of code will convert the OTS file to PDF and save it to the specified output path.
## Step 5: Display Completion Message
Finally, inform the user that the conversion process has been successfully completed.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.\nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message notifies the user about the location where the converted PDF file has been saved.
