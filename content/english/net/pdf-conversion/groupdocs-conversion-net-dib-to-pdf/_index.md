## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the implementation process into manageable steps.

### Converting DIB to PDF

#### Overview
This feature converts a DIB file into a universally accessible PDF format. We'll cover loading the DIB file and configuring conversion settings for optimal results.

#### Step 1: Load the Source DIB File
First, set up your output directory and load the source DIB file:

```csharp
using System.IO;

string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dib-converted-to.pdf");

// Replace with an actual path to your DIB file
var dibFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.dib";
```

#### Step 2: Configure PDF Conversion Options
Next, configure the conversion options tailored for PDF output:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
// You can set additional options here as needed
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion and Save the Output
Finally, execute the conversion process and save the resulting PDF file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(dibFilePath))
{
    // Convert DIB to PDF using the specified options
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
    Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** File not found errors. Ensure your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Solution:** Double-check directory paths and confirm that the DIB file exists at the specified location.
