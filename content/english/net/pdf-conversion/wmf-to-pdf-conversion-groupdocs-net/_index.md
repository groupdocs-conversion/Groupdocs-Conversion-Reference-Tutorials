## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll walk through the steps to convert WMF files using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Loading and Converting WMF Files
#### Overview
GroupDocs.Conversion provides an easy-to-use interface to handle various file formats, including WMF. Let's explore how to load and convert a WMF file.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter
Start by creating a `Converter` object with your source WMF file path:
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here

```
This step ensures that GroupDocs.Conversion can access and process the file.

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Define the target format for conversion. For instance, converting a WMF to PDF:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
The `PdfConvertOptions` class specifies settings for converting files into PDFs.
