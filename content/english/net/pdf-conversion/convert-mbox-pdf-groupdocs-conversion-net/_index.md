using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Set up license if available
        // License license = new License();
        // license.SetLicense("Path to License File");

        string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Set your MBOX file path here

        using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialized GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the code to understand how we can load an MBOX file and convert it into a PDF.

### Feature: Load MBOX File
This feature explains loading an MBOX file using specific options provided by GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Setup Load Options
Use `MboxLoadOptions` when you know your source format is MBOX. This ensures that the converter correctly processes the email file structure.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Set your document directory path here

// Load the source MBOX file with specific load options if it's an MBOX format.
var converter = new Converter(documentPath, (LoadContext loadContext) => 
{
    return loadContext.SourceFormat == EmailFileType.Mbox ? new MboxLoadOptions() : null;
});
```

#### Step 2: Dispose of Resources
Always ensure you dispose of the `Converter` object to free up resources.

```csharp
// Ensure to properly dispose of the converter when done
converter.Dispose();
```

### Feature: Convert MBOX to PDF
Now, let's convert our loaded MBOX file into a PDF document.

#### Step 1: Configure Output Path
Set your desired output directory and create an appropriate file naming template.

```csharp
using System.IO;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Set your output directory path here
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mbox-converted-{0}-to.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Define Conversion Options
Create PDF conversion options using `PdfConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var pdfConvertOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();
int counter = 1;
```

#### Step 3: Execute Conversion
Perform the conversion and save each output file with a unique name.

```csharp
converter.Convert(
    (SaveContext saveContext) => 
        new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, counter++), FileMode.Create),
    pdfConvertOptions
);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure the `documentPath` is correct and accessible.
- Verify that your output directory has write permissions.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases for converting MBOX to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion:
1. **Archiving Emails**: Convert email archives into a more universally accepted format like PDF for long-term storage.
2. **Email Backup Systems**: Integrate conversion capabilities into backup solutions that require a non-email specific format.
3. **Legal Documentation**: Use the converted PDFs as part of legal documentation and evidence management systems.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion, consider these tips:
- **Batch Processing**: Convert files in batches to manage memory usage efficiently.
- **Resource Management**: Always dispose of objects like `Converter` properly.
- **Optimize Settings**: Use appropriate load and conversion options tailored to your specific needs.
