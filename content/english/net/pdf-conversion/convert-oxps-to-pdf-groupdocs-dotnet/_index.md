# How to Convert OXPS Files to PDF Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Converting XPS files into a universally accepted format like PDF is essential in both professional and personal environments. This guide will walk you through using **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** to seamlessly convert OXPS files to PDFs.

- What You'll Learn:
  - Setting up your environment with GroupDocs.Conversion.
  - Step-by-step instructions on converting OXPS files to PDF format.
  - Key configuration options and best practices for performance optimization.

Let's start by ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries**: GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET version 25.3.0.
- **Environment Setup**: A development environment capable of running C# code, such as Visual Studio.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with file handling in .NET.

With these prerequisites covered, let's move on to setting up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Conversion, install it via NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the Converter object with an input OXPS file path
        using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.oxps"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name

Start by defining where your converted PDF will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "oxps-converted-to.pdf");
```

### Step 2: Load the Source OXPS File

Load your source file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class. This handles the initial setup and prepares your document for conversion.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.oxps"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Source OXPS file loaded.");
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Conversion Options

Configure PDF-specific options using `PdfConvertOptions`. This allows you to specify settings relevant to the output format.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
Console.WriteLine("PDF conversion options set.");
```

### Step 4: Convert and Save the File

Finally, use the `Convert` method to execute the conversion and save your PDF file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully!");
```
