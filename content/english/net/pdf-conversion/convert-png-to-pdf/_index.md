# Convert PNG to PDF

## Introduction
In today's digital age, efficient conversion of file formats is crucial for various applications. Whether it's for document management, archiving, or sharing, being able to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is invaluable. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to convert PNG images to PDF documents using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. GroupDocs.Conversion is a powerful document conversion API that provides developers with the tools they need to effortlessly convert files between different formats.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET SDK: Download and install the SDK from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the SDK in your development environment.
2. Development Environment: Have a .NET development environment set up on your machine. This can be Visual Studio or any other IDE that supports .NET development.
3. Source PNG File: Prepare the PNG image file that you want to convert to PDF. Ensure you have the file stored in a directory accessible to your .NET application.

## Import Namespaces
To begin the conversion process, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your .NET application. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for file conversion.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
First, specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved, and define the name of the output file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "png-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source PNG File
Next, load the source PNG file that you intend to convert to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_PNG))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_PNG` with the path to your PNG file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options according to your requirements. In this case, we'll use PdfConvertOptions for converting PNG to PDF.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
You can customize conversion options such as page orientation, margins, quality, etc., based on your needs.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Now, initiate the conversion process by calling the `Convert` method of the Converter object and passing the output file path along with the conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This will convert the PNG image to a PDF document and save it to the specified output file path.
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
Finally, inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the path to the output PDF file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message ensures that the user knows where to find the converted PDF file.

In conclusion, GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET provides a simple yet powerful solution for converting PNG images to PDF documents seamlessly.
