## Implementation Guide

### Extracting and Converting Files from RAR to PDF

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how to extract files from a RAR archive and convert them into PDF format. Let's break down the steps.

#### Step 1: Load the RAR Archive
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Contracts;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string rarPath = "path/to/your/archive.rar";

// Initialize the converter with RAR file
using (var converter = new Converter(rarPath))
{
    // Process each file in the archive
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();

// Customize conversion settings as needed
options.MarginTop = 10;
options.MarginBottom = 10;

// Convert and save PDF
converter.Convert("output.pdf", options);
```

### Explanation:
- **Load the RAR Archive**: Initialize a `Converter` object with your RAR file path.
- **Configure Conversion Options**: Create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` to customize your PDF output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
