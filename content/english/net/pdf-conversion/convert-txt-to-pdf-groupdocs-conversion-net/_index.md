## Implementation Guide

### Load Source TXT File

This section demonstrates loading a source `.txt` file using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter Object

Set up your `Converter` object with the path of your text file:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.txt";
var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
// The loaded 'converter' can now be used for further conversion operations.
```

This step ensures your application knows the source text file location. The `Converter` object facilitates all subsequent conversion actions.

### Convert TXT to PDF

Transforming a `.txt` document into a PDF is straightforward with GroupDocs.Conversion's built-in options.

#### Step 2: Define Output Parameters

Set up your output directory and define where the converted PDF will be saved:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "txt-converted-to.pdf");
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Use the `PdfConvertOptions` to execute the conversion and save your document:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
// Your converted PDF is now saved in the specified output directory.
```

This section highlights how GroupDocs.Conversion simplifies converting text files into a versatile format.
