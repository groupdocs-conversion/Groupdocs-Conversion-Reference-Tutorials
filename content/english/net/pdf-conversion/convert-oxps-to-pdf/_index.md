Whether you're dealing with OXPS files and need them in PDF format or vice versa, GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET comes to the rescue. This powerful library simplifies the conversion process, allowing developers to seamlessly transform documents from one format to another with minimal effort.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
First and foremost, you need to have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the provided link: [Download GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/)
### 2. Obtain a License (Optional)
While GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be used without a license, obtaining one can unlock additional features and benefits. You can acquire a temporary license from: [Get Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)
### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
Ensure that you have a working .NET development environment set up on your system. This includes having Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE installed.

## Import Namespaces
To begin the conversion process, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This step ensures that you have access to the required classes and methods for document conversion.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

Now that you have the prerequisites sorted and the necessary namespaces imported, let's break down the conversion process into simple steps:
## Step 1: Specify Output Directory and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "oxps-converted-to.pdf");
```
In this step, define the directory where you want the converted PDF file to be saved and specify the output file name.
## Step 2: Load the Source OXPS File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_OXPS))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```
Instantiate a new `Converter` object by providing the path to the source OXPS file. This initializes the conversion process.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Create an instance of the desired conversion options. In this case, we're converting OXPS to PDF, so we use `PdfConvertOptions`.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Invoke the `Convert` method on the `Converter` object, passing the output file path and conversion options as arguments. This executes the conversion process.
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the path to the converted PDF file.

## Conclusion
GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET simplifies the task of document conversion, allowing developers to effortlessly convert OXPS files to PDF and vice versa. By following the step-by-step guide outlined above and leveraging the power of this library, you can seamlessly integrate document conversion capabilities into your .NET applications.
