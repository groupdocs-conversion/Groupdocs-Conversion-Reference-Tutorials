}
```

- **Parameter**: Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.j2c"` with the actual path to your file.

### Converting to PDF

#### Overview

Convert your J2C file to a PDF by specifying PDF-specific conversion options. This step transforms your image into a universally accessible format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Set Conversion Options**

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

- **Purpose**: `PdfConvertOptions` specifies that the output should be in PDF format.

**Execute Conversion**

```csharp
string outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/j2c-converted-to.pdf";
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
