# Convert Emails to PDF in .NET Using GroupDocs.Conversion

## Introduction

Converting emails, along with their attachments, into professional-looking PDF documents can be a tedious task if done manually. With **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**, you can automate this process seamlessly.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through converting email documents and their attachments to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion in a .NET environment. This solution is ideal for developers looking to integrate such functionality into their applications efficiently.

### What You’ll Learn:
- Setting up **GroupDocs.Conversion** for .NET
- Configuring the library to convert emails and attachments to PDF
- Practical code implementation with detailed explanations
- Real-world applications of this feature

Let’s dive into the prerequisites before we start coding.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following in place:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** version 25.3.0
- A basic understanding of C# programming
- Familiarity with handling file I/O operations in .NET

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your development environment supports the .NET framework (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework).

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic knowledge of object-oriented programming and familiarity with using NuGet packages will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start working with **GroupDocs.Conversion**, you need to install it. Here’s how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: Download a trial version from the [GroupDocs website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) to explore basic functionalities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for full-feature access via [this link](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
- **Purchase**: For long-term use, purchase a license through the [GroupDocs purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

#### Basic Initialization and Setup with C#

Here's how to set up your project for conversion:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

This namespace includes all necessary classes for document conversion.

## Implementation Guide

Let’s break down the implementation into logical sections, focusing on converting an email along with its attachments.

### Configure Load Options

First, configure load options to specify how your email documents should be handled during conversion. This involves setting properties like `ConvertOwner` and `ConvertOwned`.

```csharp
Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> getLoadOptions = loadContext => new EmailLoadOptions
{
    ConvertOwner = true,
    ConvertOwned = true,
    Depth = 2 // Includes attachments in the conversion process
};
```

### Initialize the Converter

Next, initialize the `Converter` class with your email document and the previously defined load options.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath, getLoadOptions))
{
    int index = 1; // Index for naming output files
    
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions(); // Set conversion options to PDF
    
    // Define a callback function for saving each converted document or attachment
    converter.Convert((SaveContext saveContext) =>
    {
        string fileName = index == 1 ? "converted.pdf" : $"converted-attachment-{index - 1}.pdf";
        index++;
        string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, fileName); // Construct full output path
        return new FileStream(outputFile, FileMode.Create); // Create file stream for each converted document
    }, options);
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **LoadOptions**: Controls how the email and its attachments are processed.
- **Converter Class**: Manages the conversion process from input to PDF.
- **PdfConvertOptions**: Specifies that the output format should be PDF.
- **SaveContext Callback**: Handles file naming and storage for each converted document or attachment.

### Troubleshooting Tips
Ensure all paths in `inputFilePath` and `outputFolder` are correctly set. Verify that the depth parameter is sufficient to include all attachments.

## Practical Applications

1. **Document Management Systems**: Automatically convert received emails into PDFs for archival purposes.
2. **Customer Support Platforms**: Convert email threads with attachments into PDFs for better documentation.
3. **Legal Firms**: Preserve communication records by converting legal correspondence and its attachments.
4. **Integration with CRM**: Enhance customer relationship management systems by integrating email-to-PDF conversion.

## Performance Considerations

### Tips for Optimizing Performance
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple emails in batches to reduce overhead.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async methods where applicable to enhance responsiveness.
- **Resource Management**: Dispose of file streams and resources promptly to free memory.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
Ensure you're using `using` statements or explicitly calling `Dispose()` on objects like streams to manage resources effectively.

## Conclusion
