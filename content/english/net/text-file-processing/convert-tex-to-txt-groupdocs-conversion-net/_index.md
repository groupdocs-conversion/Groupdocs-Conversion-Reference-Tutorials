## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Converting a TEX File to TXT

This section demonstrates how to load a TEX file and convert it into a TXT format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define Paths

Start by defining the paths for your input document and output directory:
```csharp
string texFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.tex";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "tex-converted-to.txt");
```
#### Step 2: Initialize Converter

Load the source TEX file using the `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(texFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```
#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options

Configure conversion options to convert the document into TXT format. This step involves setting specific properties related to word processing formats.
```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```
