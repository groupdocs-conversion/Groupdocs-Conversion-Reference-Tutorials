By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped with the skills needed to implement this functionality in your .NET projects. Let’s start with the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Required Libraries:** GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (Version 25.3.0 or later)
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and file handling in .NET

With these prerequisites covered, let’s move on to setting up GroupDocs.Conversion for your project.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To use the GroupDocs.Conversion library, install it using one of the following methods:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**\.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers various licensing options:
- **Free Trial:** Access full features for a limited time.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license to evaluate the library without limitations.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a commercial license.

To get started with a trial or request a temporary license, visit [GroupDocs’ purchase and trials page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

namespace ConversionApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the conversion handler
            using (var converter = new Converter("sample.xps"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Conversion initialized.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert XPS to TXT

This section provides a detailed approach for converting an XPS file into a text format.

#### Overview
Converting XPS files to TXT allows for easier manipulation and integration with other systems, as plain text is universally accessible.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define File Paths**
Set up your input and output directories:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\";

// Input XPS file path
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xps");

// Output TXT file path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xps-converted-to.txt");
```

**2. Load the Source XPS File**
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your source file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    Console.WriteLine("XPS file loaded successfully.");
}
```

**3. Set Conversion Options**
Configure conversion settings for TXT output:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```
Here, `WordProcessingConvertOptions` specifies the text format.

**4. Perform the Conversion**
Execute the conversion process and save the result:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and licensed.
- Check for exceptions or errors during execution to identify issues.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Migration:** Convert XPS documents to TXT for easier data migration projects.
2. **Integration with Text Analysis Tools:** Use converted TXT files in natural language processing (NLP) applications.
3. **Archiving and Backup:** Store important documents in a universally accessible format like TXT.

These use cases demonstrate the flexibility of the conversion process, allowing integration into broader .NET systems.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when handling document conversions:
- Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
- Monitor memory usage and manage resources efficiently, especially with large documents.
- Follow best practices for .NET memory management to prevent leaks and ensure smooth operation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain high-performance standards in your applications using GroupDocs.Conversion.
