       {
           // Initialize the Converter object with your PDF file path
           string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.pdf";
           using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
           {
               // Conversion logic will go here

       }
   }
   ```

This setup prepares you to handle conversion tasks seamlessly.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: PDF to PSD Conversion

Converting a PDF file into a PSD format is invaluable for graphic designers who need editable layers. Let's break down the process:

#### Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Paths

Set up directories for input and output files. Adjust paths as needed.

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.pdf";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
```

#### Step 2: Create a Stream Function

We'll use a function to generate streams for each page being converted. This ensures that every PSD file is named correctly.

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext =>
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Conversion Options

Define the conversion options to specify that we're converting to PSD format.

```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Psd };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion using the `Converter` object and your defined settings.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Convert each page of the PDF to PSD format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all file paths are correct.
- Verify that you have write permissions for your output directory.
- Check GroupDocs.Conversion documentation if encountering errors.

## Practical Applications

1. **Graphic Design:** Automate the conversion of multi-page PDFs into individual PSD files for editing in Photoshop.
2. **Marketing Materials:** Quickly convert promotional documents from static PDF to editable formats.
3. **Archival Projects:** Convert old documents stored as PDFs into PSDs for digital archiving with layer information.

## Performance Considerations

### Tips for Optimizing Performance

- Process one file at a time if memory usage is high.
- Use efficient I/O operations to handle large files.
- Monitor resource utilization and adjust batch sizes accordingly.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management

Dispose of streams promptly after use, especially in loops. This prevents memory leaks and ensures smooth performance during conversions.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've explored how to convert PDFs to PSDs using GroupDocs.Conversion .NET efficiently. By following the steps outlined, you can automate this process for various applications, from graphic design to marketing projects.

### Next Steps
