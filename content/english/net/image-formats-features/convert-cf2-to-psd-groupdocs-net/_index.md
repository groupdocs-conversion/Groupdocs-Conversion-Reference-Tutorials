{
    // Conversion operations can be performed here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This section outlines the steps for converting CF2 files to PSD format using GroupDocs.Conversion, focusing on key features of the library.

### Load CF2 File

**Overview:**
Loading a CF2 file is your first step. This involves setting up paths and using the `Converter` class to open your file.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define Constants for File Paths:**
   ```csharp
   private const string DocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   private const string SampleCf2FilePath = Path.Combine(DocumentDirectory, "sample.cf2");
   ```
2. **Load the CF2 File:**
   Use the `Converter` class to load your CF2 file.
   
   ```csharp
   using (Converter converter = new Converter(SampleCf2FilePath))
   {
       // The CF2 file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
   }
   ```

### Set Conversion Options

**Overview:**
To convert a file to PSD format, you need to define specific options that the library will use during the conversion.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Define Image Conversion Options:**
   
   ```csharp
   ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
   ```

   This sets up your file for conversion to PSD format, specifying key properties of the output image.

### Convert CF2 to PSD

**Overview:**
This feature combines loading and setting options with executing the conversion process. It’s where everything comes together to produce a PSD file from your CF2 input.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up Output Directory and File Template:**
   
   ```csharp
   private const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   private const string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
   
   Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
       new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
   ```
2. **Perform the Conversion:**
   Execute the conversion with defined options.

   ```csharp
   using (Converter converter = new Converter(SampleCf2FilePath))
   {
       ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
       
       // Convert and save each page as a PSD file
       converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
   }
   ```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure all paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that the necessary permissions for reading/writing files are in place.
