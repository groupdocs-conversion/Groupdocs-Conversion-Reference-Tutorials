using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion options can be configured here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's delve into converting your ICO files to SVG format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Load the Source ICO File and Set Conversion Options

1. **Specify Document Paths:**
   Begin by setting up paths for your source and output directories:
    
    ```csharp
    string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
    string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
    ```

2. **Load Your ICO File:**
   Use the `Converter` class to load your ICO file:
    
    ```csharp
    string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ico");
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ico-converted-to.svg");

    using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
    {
        // Conversion logic will be added here
    }
    ```

3. **Set SVG Conversion Options:**
   Define conversion options for the output format:
    
    ```csharp
    PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions 
    { 
        Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg 
    };
    ```

4. **Perform Conversion and Save Output:**
   Execute the conversion and save the SVG file:
    
    ```csharp
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
    ```
   
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your ICO file path is correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that output directories have write permissions.

## Practical Applications

This feature can be integrated into various applications such as:
1. **Web Design:** Enhancing website graphics with scalable SVG icons.
