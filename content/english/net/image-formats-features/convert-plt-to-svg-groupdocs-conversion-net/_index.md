## Implementation Guide

### Load and Convert PLT File to SVG

This feature allows you to convert a PLT file into an SVG format, which is widely used for scalable vector graphics.

#### Step 1: Define the Output Directory

First, set up where your converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "plt-converted-to.svg");
```

#### Step 2: Load the PLT File

Use the `Converter` class to load your PLT file. Replace `'sample.plt'` with your actual file path.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.plt"))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options

Define the conversion options for SVG format:
```csharp
var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
