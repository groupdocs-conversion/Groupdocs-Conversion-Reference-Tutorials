// Initialize Converter object
global using (Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_JPM"))
{
    // Configuration will follow...
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### File Conversion Setup
This feature demonstrates how to set up the conversion process from JPM to PSD format. It includes defining an output directory and a template for naming converted files.
#### Define Output Directory
Set your desired output folder where the converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```
#### Template Naming for Converted Files
Create a function that generates file paths dynamically based on conversion results:
```csharp
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```
### Loading the Source File
Load your source JPM file for conversion using the `Converter` class.
#### Initialize Converter with Source File
```csharp
global using (Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_JPM"))
{
    // Conversion setup will be implemented next...
}
```
### Setting Conversion Options
Configure options needed to convert an image from JPM format to PSD.
#### Define Image Conversion Options
Set the target file format and other relevant parameters:
```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
```
### Performing File Conversion
Execute the conversion using predefined options and an output stream function.
#### Execute Conversion
Perform the actual file conversion with the `Convert` method:
```csharp
current.Convert(getPageStream, options);
```
