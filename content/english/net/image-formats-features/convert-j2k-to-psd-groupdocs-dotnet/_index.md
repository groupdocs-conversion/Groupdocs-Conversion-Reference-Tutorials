#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here’s how you can set up GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize the converter with a J2K file path
        using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your/file.j2k"))
        {
            // Set up conversion options for PSD format
            var convertOptions = new PsdConvertOptions();
            
            // Convert and save the output PSD file
            converter.Convert("output/path/output.psd", convertOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

This code initializes a `Converter` object with your J2K file and converts it to PSD using specified options.
