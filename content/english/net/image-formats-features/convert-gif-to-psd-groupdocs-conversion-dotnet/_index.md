```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

With setup complete, let’s proceed to convert GIFs to PSD.

## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through implementing the conversion feature using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Load and Convert a GIF File

#### Overview
The core functionality involves loading a GIF file and configuring it to be converted into a PSD format. Let’s break down each step:

**1. Define Paths**
Set up your input and output directories:
```csharp
string inputGifPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.gif"; // Replace with your actual path
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Create Output Template**
Configure the naming template for converted files:
```csharp
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

**3. Initialize the Converter**
Use the `Converter` class to load your GIF file:
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputGifPath))
{
    // Configure conversion options for PSD format
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
    
    // Perform the conversion from GIF to PSD
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

#### Explanation
- **`Converter Class`**: Initializes with the source GIF path.
- **`ImageConvertOptions`**: Specifies that the output format should be PSD. Other configurations can also be set here based on requirements.
- **`converter.Convert()`**: Executes the conversion process using the specified options and stream handling logic.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the input GIF path is correct and accessible.
- Verify write permissions for the output directory.
- Check if you have installed the correct version of GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Practical Applications

Understanding where this feature can be applied enhances its value. Here are a few scenarios:
1. **Graphic Design Projects**: Convert animated GIFs from web sources into PSD files for editing in Adobe Photoshop.
2. **Digital Marketing Assets**: Transform marketing graphics to high-quality formats suitable for print and digital media campaigns.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Integrate the conversion feature into a CMS for automated graphic format management.

## Performance Considerations

When dealing with file conversions, performance is key:
- Optimize input data size by compressing GIFs before conversion.
- Manage resources efficiently to avoid memory overflow during large batch processing.
- Utilize GroupDocs.Conversion's configuration options to fine-tune the conversion process for better performance and output quality.
