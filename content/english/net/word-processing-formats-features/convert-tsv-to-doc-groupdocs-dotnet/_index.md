## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: TSV to DOC Conversion

This feature allows you to convert tab-separated values files into the widely-used Word document format, enhancing data accessibility and presentation.

#### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths

Specify where your source TSV file is located and where the output DOC file should be saved:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string sourceTsvFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.tsv");
string outputDocFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "tsv-converted-to.doc");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter Class

Load your TSV file using the `Converter` class from GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceTsvFilePath))
{
    // Conversion process will go here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options

Specify that you want to convert the file to a DOC format with these settings:
```csharp
var convertOptions = new WordProcessingConvertOptions 
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

#### Step 4: Execute Conversion

Finally, perform the conversion and save the output:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputDocFilePath, convertOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found**: Ensure your file paths are correct.
- **Conversion Errors**: Check that your GroupDocs license is properly set up.

## Practical Applications

Here are a few scenarios where TSV to DOC conversion can be invaluable:
1. **Data Reporting**: Convert raw data files into professional reports for presentations or publications.
