    }
}
```

This code snippet sets up your environment, ready to start converting files.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have everything set up, let's implement the Markdown to Word conversion feature.

### Feature Overview

This section will guide you through converting a Markdown file into a Microsoft Word Document using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. We'll break down each step to ensure clarity and understanding.

#### Step 1: Initialize Converter

Firstly, we initialize the converter with the path of our input Markdown file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.md"))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```

**Explanation:** This step creates a `Converter` object, which is responsible for handling the document conversion process.

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options

Next, define the conversion options to specify that we want a DOC format output:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

**Explanation:** Here, we configure our `WordProcessingConvertOptions` to target the DOC file type.

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Finally, execute the conversion and save the output:

```csharp
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "md-converted-to.doc");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Explanation:** This line converts the Markdown document into a Word file, saving it to your specified directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary packages are installed.
- **Incorrect Paths:** Double-check your input and output paths for accuracy.
- **License Issues:** If you encounter any licensing errors, verify that your license is correctly applied.
