            Console.WriteLine("Setup Complete!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let’s convert ODS files to DOCX.

### Conversion Overview
This feature enables you to convert an ODS file (Open Document Spreadsheet) into a DOCX format. The conversion ensures spreadsheet data is seamlessly translated into editable Word documents.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Firstly, specify the directory paths for your source and output files:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path

// Define the file paths
double sourceOdsFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ods");
double outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ods-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load and Convert ODS File
Utilize GroupDocs.Conversion to load your ODS file and convert it:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceOdsFilePath))
{
    // Set conversion options for Word Processing format, specifically DOCX.
    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    
    // Perform the conversion from ODS to DOCX and save the output file.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

#### Explanation
- **Converter Class:** Loads your source document.
- **WordProcessingConvertOptions:** Specifies that the target format is DOCX.
- **converter.Convert Method:** Executes the actual conversion process.

### Troubleshooting Tips
1. Ensure paths are correctly specified to avoid file not found errors.
2. Check for any exceptions during runtime and handle them appropriately.
3. Verify permissions for reading and writing files in your directories.

## Practical Applications
Converting ODS to DOCX has numerous real-world applications:
- **Data Reporting:** Transform spreadsheet data into comprehensive reports.
- **Business Documentation:** Convert financial spreadsheets for executive summaries.
- **Educational Material:** Share lesson plans initially created in ODS format with Word-based documents.

Integration possibilities include working alongside other .NET systems like ASP.NET Core or Windows Forms, enhancing document management solutions.

## Performance Considerations
When dealing with large files:
- Optimize memory usage by handling file streams efficiently.
- Use asynchronous methods to improve performance if supported by your application context.
- Regularly monitor resource consumption and adjust settings as needed for optimal throughput.
