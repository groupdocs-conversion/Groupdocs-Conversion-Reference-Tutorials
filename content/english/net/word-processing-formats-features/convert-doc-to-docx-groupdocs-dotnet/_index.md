# Step-by-Step Guide: Convert DOC to DOCX Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Converting documents from one format to another is a common task for developers working with document management systems, content automation, or even custom applications. If you're working within a .NET environment and want a reliable, accurate way to convert DOC files to DOCX, GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is your best friend.

In this comprehensive guide, I’ll walk you through the entire process. We’ll cover everything from prerequisites to step-by-step code examples. Ready? Let’s jump right into it!

## Prerequisites

Before diving into coding, let's ensure you’re set up with everything you need:

- **Visual Studio** (2015 or above recommended) – for developing your .NET applications.
- **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core/6+** – compatible with GroupDocs.Conversion.
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** library – download from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
- A sample DOC file to work with.
- Basic knowledge of C# and Visual Studio.

Got all that? Great! Now, let’s get everything ready for the conversion process.

## Import Packages

The first thing we need to do is add the necessary packages to your project. Here’s how:

### Step 1: Download GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Visit the [downloads page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) and grab the latest version compatible with your project.

### Step 2: Add the DLLs to Your Project

Extract the downloaded package, then:

- In Visual Studio, right-click on your project.
- Choose **Add** → **Reference**.
- Browse to the location of the GroupDocs.Conversion DLL files.
- Select `GroupDocs.Conversion.dll` (and other dependencies if any).

### Step 3: Use Namespace in Your Code

In your C# file, include the following using statement:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

This enables you to easily access conversion classes and options.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Converting DOC to DOCX

Let's break down the conversion process into manageable, easy-to-follow steps, just like following a recipe.

### Step 1: Set the Output Path

First, define where you want your converted file to go. It’s important to organize your output files for easy access later.

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"C:\ConvertedFiles"; // You can change this path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ConvertedDocument.docx");
```

**Tip:** Make sure the output folder exists or create it dynamically in your code.

### Step 2: Load the Source DOC File

Next, load your source DOC file. GroupDocs provides a straightforward way to do this with the `Converter` class.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(@"C:\InputFiles\Sample.doc"))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```

**Note:** Replace the path with the location of your actual DOC file.

### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

Before converting, specify how the conversion should occur with options tailored for Word files.

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

This class automatically determines the appropriate settings for document conversion to Word formats such as DOCX.

### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Now, convert the document and save it to your specified location.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

This single line processes the DOC file and saves the new DOCX version in your output folder.

### Step 5: Confirm & Output Success Message

Always good practice to notify yourself when the process finishes successfully!

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Conversion complete! Check the output at {outputFolder}");
```

Make sure to handle exceptions in real applications to catch errors like file not found, permission issues, etc.

## Complete Sample Code

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

namespace DocumentConversionExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Define file paths
            string inputPath = @"C:\InputFiles\Sample.doc";
            string outputFolder = @"C:\ConvertedFiles";
            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "Sample-converted.docx");

            try
            {
                // Ensure output directory exists
                if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
                {
                    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
                }

                // Initialize converter with the source DOC file
                using (var converter = new Converter(inputPath))
                {
                    // Configure conversion options
                    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();

                    // Execute conversion
                    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
                }

                Console.WriteLine($"Conversion to DOCX completed! Check: {outputFile}");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error during conversion: {ex.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```
