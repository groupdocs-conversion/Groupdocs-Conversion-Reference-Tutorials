## Implementation Guide

This section guides you through converting DOTM files to DOCX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Feature 1: Load and Convert DOTM to DOCX

#### Overview:
Demonstrates how to load a .dotm file and convert it into a .docx format efficiently.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Load the Source DOTM File**
First, specify the path of your source DOTM file. Ensure this directory is accessible by your application.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.dotm");
```

**Define Output Path for Converted DOCX File**
Next, define where you want the converted file to be saved. This path should also be accessible and writable.
```csharp
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "dotm-converted-to.docx");
```

**Configure Conversion Options**
Set up conversion options specific for Word processing formats, determining how the document will convert.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

**Perform the Conversion**
Execute the conversion process from DOTM to DOCX using the configured options.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
}
```

### Feature 2: Manage Output Directory Paths

#### Overview:
Shows how to handle input and output directory paths efficiently in your application.

**Define a Method for Output Directory Path**
Create a method that returns the path of the output directory. Replace this logic with actual methods as needed.
```csharp
string GetOutputDirectoryPath()
{
    return Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
}
```

**Use the Defined Paths in Your Application**
Define where files will be read from and saved to, ensuring organized file management.
```csharp
string outputFolder = GetOutputDirectoryPath();
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dotm-converted-to.docx");
```
