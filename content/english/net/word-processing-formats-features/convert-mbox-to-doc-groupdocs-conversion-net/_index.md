## Implementation Guide

### Load MBOX File

**Overview:** This section demonstrates how to load an MBOX file, which is the first step in our conversion process.

#### Step 1: Define the Path and Load Options
Set up your path and create loading options for the MBOX file.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

string sampleMboxPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.mbox";
var mboxLoadOptions = new MboxLoadOptions();
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter
Create a `Converter` instance using your file path and load options.

```csharp
var converter = new Converter(sampleMboxPath, (loadContext) => 
    loadContext.SourceFormat == EmailFileType.Mbox ? mboxLoadOptions : null);
```

### Configure Conversion Options for DOC Format

**Overview:** Set up the conversion parameters to convert the loaded MBOX file into a DOC format.

#### Step 1: Define Conversion Options
Create an instance of `WordProcessingConvertOptions` and specify the target format as DOC.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

WordProcessingConvertOptions docConversionOptions = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

### Perform Conversion and Save DOC File

**Overview:** Execute the conversion process and save the resulting DOC files.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Path and Template
Define your output directory and file naming template for the converted documents.

```csharp
using System.IO;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mbox-converted-{0}-to.doc");
int counter = 1;
```

#### Step 2: Execute Conversion
Perform the conversion and save each document to the specified path.

```csharp
converter.Convert(
    (saveContext) => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, counter++), FileMode.Create),
    docConversionOptions);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure file paths are correctly set.
- Check for sufficient permissions on the output directory.
- Verify that the MBOX file is not corrupted.
