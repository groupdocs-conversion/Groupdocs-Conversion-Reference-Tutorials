## Introduction

Converting Excel templates (.xlt) into Word documents (.docx) can streamline your document automation workflows significantly. This step-by-step tutorial guides you through using **GroupDocs.Conversion** in a .NET environment to convert XLT files to DOCX format effortlessly.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Installing and setting up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
- Converting an XLT file to DOCX format
- Performance optimization tips for using GroupDocs.Conversion

Let's start with the prerequisites before we dive in.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- **.NET Development Environment**: Visual Studio (2017 or later) is recommended.
- **GroupDocs.Conversion Library**: We'll be using version 25.3.0 of this library.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with .NET programming concepts will help in understanding and implementing the code.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To begin, install the GroupDocs.Conversion package via NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial of their products, which you can download to test their capabilities before making a purchase. You can also request a temporary license for extended use.

To start using the library, initialize it in your C# project with basic setup:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize conversion configuration (if needed)
var config = new ConversionConfig();
```

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define File Paths and Setup Converter

Start by specifying the input XLT file and the output DOCX file paths.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define your document directory and output directory
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Input XLT file and output DOCX file paths
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xlt");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlt-converted-to.docx");

// Initialize the converter object with your input XLT file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here
}
```

### Step 2: Configure DOCX Conversion Options

Set up conversion options tailored for Word Processing formats:

```csharp
// Set up conversion options for DOCX format
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save your output file:

```csharp
// Convert the XLT file to DOCX and save it
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure paths are correctly set for both input and output files.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library is properly installed and referenced.
