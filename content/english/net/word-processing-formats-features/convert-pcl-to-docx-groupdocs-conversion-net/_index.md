### Load and Convert PCL File to DOCX

This section demonstrates loading a Printer Command Language (PCL) file and converting it into a Microsoft Word Open XML Document (.docx).

#### Define Directories and File Paths
First, specify your source PCL file location and the output path for the converted DOCX file:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your directory path.
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your output path.

// Define input and output files.
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.pcl");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "pcl-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Load the Source PCL File
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your PCL file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion options are set here.
}
