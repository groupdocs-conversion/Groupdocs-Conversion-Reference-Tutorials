string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ott-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source OTT File
Use the `Converter` class to load your source file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Specify conversion options for Word processing:
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Convert and Save the Output
Perform the conversion and save the output as a DOCX file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
