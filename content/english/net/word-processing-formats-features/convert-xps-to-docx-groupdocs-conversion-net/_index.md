namespace DocumentConversionApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the Converter object with the path to an XPS file
            using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xps"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This section walks through converting an XPS document into DOCX format.

### Loading and Converting XPS to DOCX

#### Overview
This feature allows you to load an existing XPS file and convert it into a Word document (DOCX) using GroupDocs.Conversion.

##### Step 1: Define Input and Output Directories
First, specify the directories for your source XPS file and output DOCX file:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\";
string outputFileDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\";
```

##### Step 2: Load the Source XPS File
Using GroupDocs.Conversion, load the XPS document you wish to convert:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentDirectory + "sample.xps"))
{
    Console.WriteLine("XPS file loaded.");
}
```

##### Step 3: Set Conversion Options for DOCX Format
Specify that you want to convert your document into a Word processing format (DOCX):
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
Console.WriteLine("Conversion options set.");
```

##### Step 4: Perform the Conversion and Save the Result
Execute the conversion process and save the output as a DOCX file:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFileDirectory, "xps-converted-to.docx");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** File path errors. Ensure all directory paths are correct.
- **Solution for Slow Conversion:** Optimize your input file size or system resources.

## Practical Applications

Here are scenarios where converting XPS to DOCX is beneficial:
1. **Document Archiving:** Convert legacy documents from XPS format into editable DOCX files for easier access and manipulation.
2. **Collaboration:** Share documents with team members who prefer using Microsoft Word applications.
3. **Integration with Document Management Systems:** Seamlessly integrate converted DOCX files into existing document management workflows.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure your conversion process runs smoothly:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources during conversion.
- **Best Practices for Memory Management:** Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements in C# to manage memory efficiently.

## Conclusion

Converting XPS documents to DOCX format with GroupDocs.Conversion is a powerful capability easily integrated into your .NET projects. By following this guide, you've learned how to set up the environment, execute conversions, and apply best practices for optimal performance.
