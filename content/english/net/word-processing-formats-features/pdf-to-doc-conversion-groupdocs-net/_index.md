string pdfFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.pdf");

// Load the source PDF file using GroupDocs.Conversion
using (var converter = new Converter(pdfFilePath))
{
    // The converter object is now ready for further operations.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's explore each step to convert a PDF to a DOC file.

### Load Source PDF File

Begin by loading your source PDF document using GroupDocs.Conversion. This sets the foundation for subsequent conversion actions.

#### Setting Up the Document Path

Set up your document directory and construct the full path to your sample PDF:

```csharp
string pdfFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.pdf");
```

#### Loading the PDF File

Load the PDF into a converter object using this code snippet:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(pdfFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now loaded with your PDF document.
}
```

### Configure Word Processing Conversion Options

Set up conversion options for converting documents to DOC format. This configuration dictates how the input document will be treated during conversion.

#### Creating Convert Options

Configure conversion settings using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

### Convert PDF to DOC File

Execute the conversion from PDF to DOC using the configured settings.

#### Specifying Output Path

Define where your converted document will be saved:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "pdf-converted-to.doc");
```

#### Executing Conversion

Convert the PDF and save it as a DOC file using this code:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentDirectory + "/sample.pdf"))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
