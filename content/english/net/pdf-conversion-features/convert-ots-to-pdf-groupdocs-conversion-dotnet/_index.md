```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion steps will follow here
}
```

### Step 2: Set Up PDF Conversion Options

Define the options for converting to PDF. The `PdfConvertOptions` class allows you to customize your conversion process, but we'll start with the default settings.

**Overview**: Configuring conversion options ensures that the output meets your requirements.

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output PDF

Perform the conversion by calling `Convert`, passing in the output file path and the conversion options.

**Overview**: This step executes the conversion and saves the result as a PDF.

```csharp
converter.Convert("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/ots-converted-to.pdf", options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that the input OTS file exists and is accessible.
- Check directory permissions for reading and writing files.
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly installed.
