## Implementation Guide

### Remove Embedded Files from PDF

#### Overview
This feature is crucial for reducing PDF size and enhancing security by removing embedded files during conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Load the PDF Document
Start by loading your target PDF document using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.pdf"))
{
    // Proceed with further steps
}
```

##### 2. Configure Conversion Options
Utilize specific options to remove embedded files during the conversion process:

```csharp
// Create load options and set removeEmbeddedFiles option to true
PdfLoadOptions loadOptions = new PdfLoadOptions();
loadOptions.RemoveEmbeddedFiles = true;

// Apply these settings while loading the document
converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.pdf", () => loadOptions);
```

##### 3. Convert the PDF
Convert the loaded PDF into your desired format, ensuring embedded files are stripped out.

```csharp
var saveOptions = new WordProcessingSaveOptions();
string outputWord = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\", "output.docx");

// Perform the conversion
converter.Convert(outputWord, () => saveOptions);
```

#### Key Configuration Options
- `RemoveEmbeddedFiles`: A boolean parameter that dictates whether to strip embedded files.
- `PdfLoadOptions` and `SaveOptions`: Customize these for different file formats.

### Troubleshooting Tips
Common issues may include incorrect file paths or misconfigured options. Ensure all dependencies are correctly set up, and double-check the path strings in your code.

## Practical Applications
1. **Document Management Systems**: Enhance security by removing unnecessary files from PDFs before archiving.
2. **Web Publishing**: Optimize PDFs for faster loading times on websites by stripping out embedded resources.
