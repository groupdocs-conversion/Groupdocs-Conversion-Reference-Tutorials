# How to Retrieve PDF Metadata with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Tired of manually extracting information from PDF documents? Automate the task with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET and retrieve vital details such as authorship, creation dates, page count, dimensions, and more.

## What You'll Learn
- Setting up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET in your project.
- Step-by-step guidance on retrieving metadata from a PDF document.
- Integrating with other .NET systems for enhanced workflows.
- Tips for optimizing performance when working with PDFs.

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** version 25.3.0 or later installed in your project.
- A development environment set up with .NET (e.g., Visual Studio).
- Basic knowledge of C# and familiarity with working on .NET projects.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

### Installation

Install the library via NuGet Package Manager Console:

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

Or, using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial to test their features before purchase. You can get a temporary license for full access during your evaluation period.

### Initialization and Setup

Initialize the `Converter` class with the path to your PDF file:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string samplePdfPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_PDF_WITH_TOC.pdf";
using (Converter converter = new Converter(samplePdfPath))
{
    // Further operations will be performed here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Retrieve PDF Metadata

Automate the extraction of essential metadata and content details from your PDF files.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter

Create an instance of the `Converter` class, passing in the path to your target document:

```csharp
string samplePdfPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\SAMPLE_PDF_WITH_TOC.pdf";
using (Converter converter = new Converter(samplePdfPath))
{
    // Code for retrieving document information will go here.
}
```

#### Step 2: Get Document Information

Retrieve basic details using the `GetDocumentInfo` method:

```csharp
IDocumentInfo info = converter.GetDocumentInfo();
PdfDocumentInfo pdfInfo = (PdfDocumentInfo)info;
```

#### Step 3: Output Document Details

Extract and display various properties of the PDF document:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Author: {0}", pdfInfo.Author);
Console.WriteLine("Creation date: {0}", pdfInfo.CreationDate);
Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", pdfInfo.Title);
Console.WriteLine("Version: {0}", pdfInfo.Version);
Console.WriteLine("Pages count: {0}", pdfInfo.PagesCount);
Console.WriteLine("Width: {0}", pdfInfo.Width);
Console.WriteLine("Height: {0}", pdfInfo.Height);
Console.WriteLine("Is landscaped: {0}", pdfInfo.IsLandscape);
Console.WriteLine("Is Password Protected: {0}", pdfInfo.IsPasswordProtected);

// Display Table of Contents if available
if (pdfInfo.TableOfContents != null)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Table of contents");
    Console.WriteLine(new string('=', 40));
    foreach (var tocItem in pdfInfo.TableOfContents)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{tocItem.Title}: {tocItem.Page}");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** 
- `PdfDocumentInfo` provides a more specific interface for accessing PDF metadata.
- The table of contents, if present, is iterated over to display each entry.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **File Not Found Exception**: Ensure the file path is correct and accessible.
2. **Unsupported File Type**: Verify that the document is indeed a PDF or update your GroupDocs.Conversion library.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where this feature can be beneficial:

- **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Automatically populate metadata fields when uploading documents.
- **Document Archiving**: Keep track of important document details for archiving purposes.
- **PDF Review Processes**: Quickly verify the structure and metadata of PDFs before approval.

## Performance Considerations

When working with large numbers of PDFs, consider these tips:

- Process documents asynchronously to avoid blocking operations.
- Optimize memory usage by disposing of `Converter` instances promptly.
- Use batch processing where possible to minimize resource consumption.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to retrieve basic information from PDF files using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This functionality can greatly enhance your document handling workflows, making them more efficient and error-free.

### Next Steps
Experiment with other conversion features offered by GroupDocs.Conversion to further automate your document processing tasks.
