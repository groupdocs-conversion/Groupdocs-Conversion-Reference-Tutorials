// Initialize the converter with the CSV file path
Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_CSV_FILE_PATH");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Advanced Conversion Options

Focus on converting CSV files to PDFs while handling date and numeric data conversions.

#### 1. Prepare Load Options

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

// Configure load options for advanced settings\Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> getLoadOptions = loadContext => new CsvLoadOptions
{
    ConvertDateTimeData = true,
    ConvertNumericData = true
};
```
- **ConvertDateTimeData**: Converts date fields to a readable format.
- **ConvertNumericData**: Ensures numbers are correctly formatted.

#### 2. Initialize Converter

Initialize the converter with advanced load options:

```csharp
string sourceDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\\";

string inputFile = Path.Combine(sourceDirectory, "sample.csv");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pdf");

using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile, getLoadOptions))
{
    PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
- `inputFile`: Path to your CSV file.
- `outputFile`: Destination path for the PDF.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure paths to input and output directories are correct.
- Verify necessary permissions for reading/writing files.
