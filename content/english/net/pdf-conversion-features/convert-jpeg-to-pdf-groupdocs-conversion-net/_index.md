## Implementation Guide

### JPEG to PDF Conversion Feature

This section will guide you through converting a JPEG image into a PDF document using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Load the Source File

Begin by loading your source JPEG file. The `Converter` class handles this process:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.jpeg"))
{
    // Proceed with conversion steps...
}
```

*Why?* Loading the file initializes it within GroupDocs.Conversion, preparing it for processing.

#### Step 2: Define PDF Conversion Options

Specify your desired options for converting to PDF:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

*Purpose:* The `PdfConvertOptions` class allows customization of the conversion process, though default settings often suffice.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output PDF:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

*Why?* This method triggers the actual conversion process and writes the result to the specified location in PDF format.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure all necessary packages are installed via NuGet.
- **Path Errors:** Verify that file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Version Compatibility:** Check if your .NET version is compatible with GroupDocs.Conversion 25.3.0.

## Practical Applications
