## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load Source DOC File

#### Overview

Loading a DOC file is the first step in converting it to another format. This feature demonstrates how to load your document using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Define Document Path and Load

```csharp

    public class LoadSourceDocFile
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // Specify the path to your document directory.
            string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.doc");

            // Load the source DOC file using GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter
            using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Loaded the DOC file successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Parameters:** `inputFilePath` specifies the location of your document.

### Feature 2: Convert DOC to PDF

#### Overview

This feature covers converting a loaded DOC file into PDF format, demonstrating the full capabilities of GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### Define Output Path and Convert

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

namespace DocumentConversionFeatures
{
    public class ConvertDocToPdfFeature
    {
        public void Run()
        {
            // Define the output directory path.
            string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "doc-converted-to.pdf");

            // Load the source DOC file
            using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.doc")))
            {
                // Create PDF conversion options
                var options = new PdfConvertOptions();

                // Convert and save the output PDF file
                converter.Convert(outputFile, options);

                Console.WriteLine("Conversion to PDF completed successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Parameters:** 
  - `outputFolder`: Directory where the converted PDF will be saved.
  - `options`: Specifies conversion settings for PDF format.

- **Purpose:** Efficiently converts and saves a DOC file as a PDF, maintaining document fidelity.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that all file paths are correct and accessible.
- If encountering issues with large files, check system resources and consider optimizing memory usage.

## Practical Applications
