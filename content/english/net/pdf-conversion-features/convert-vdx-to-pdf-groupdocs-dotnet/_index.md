## Implementation Guide

### Convert VDX File to PDF
This section will walk you through converting a VDX file into a PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Specify Paths
First, define the input and output paths for your files:

```csharp

string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.vdx");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "vdx-converted-to.pdf");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter
Create an instance of the `Converter` class:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Specify the conversion options for PDF format:

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Perform Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file:
