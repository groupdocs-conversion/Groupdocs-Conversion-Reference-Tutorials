## Implementation Guide

### Convert DOC to TXT
This feature focuses on converting Word documents into plain text files seamlessly.

#### Step 1: Define Directory Paths
Set up the paths for your input and output directories using placeholders:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source DOC File
Load your Word document with the `Converter` class by specifying its path.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.doc")))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here.
}
```
**Why?** This step initializes the conversion process by preparing the source file for transformation.

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Define your conversion settings to specify that you're converting from Word to TXT format:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```
**Why?** This configuration ensures the output file is in the desired text format, maintaining simplicity and readability.

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save your new TXT file to a specified location:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "doc-converted-to.txt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
**Why?** This final step completes the process by generating the converted text file in your output directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure correct path syntax to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library version matches your project's requirements.
- Check for sufficient permissions on input and output directories.
