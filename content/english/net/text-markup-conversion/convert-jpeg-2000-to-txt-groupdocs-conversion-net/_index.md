    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion is ready to use!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into distinct features for clarity.

### Load J2K File

**Overview:** Loading your source J2K file prepares it for conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Specify Source Path:**

First, define where your J2K file is located:

```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.j2k";
```

**Load the File:**

Use the `Converter` class to load your file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // The converter object is now ready for conversion operations
}
```

### Configure Conversion Options

**Overview:** Configuring options ensures the conversion process meets specific requirements, such as format and settings.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Set Up TXT Conversion Options:**

Define how you want to convert the J2K file:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt
};
```

### Perform Conversion

**Overview:** Execute the conversion and save your file in the desired format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Define Output Path:**

Specify where you want the converted file saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "j2k-converted-to.txt");
```

**Execute Conversion:**

Perform the conversion using the configured options:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.j2k"))
{
    var txtOptions = ConfigureConversionOptions.GetTxtConversionOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, txtOptions);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues**: Ensure your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Library Version**: Use the appropriate version of GroupDocs.Conversion.
