        string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.txt");

        // Initialize converter
        using (Converter converter = new Converter(sourceTiffPath))
        {
            // Set up conversion options for TXT format
            var convertOptions = new TextConvertOptions();
            
            // Convert and save the output file
            converter.Convert(outputPath, convertOptions);
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This section details each feature of converting TIFF to TXT using GroupDocs.Conversion.

### Converting TIFF to TXT

#### Overview
Efficiently transform TIFF files into text format with the GroupDocs library, beneficial for extracting textual data from images or scanned documents.

#### Steps to Implement Conversion
##### 1. Configure File Paths
Define your input and output directories:
```csharp
string sourceTiffPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.tiff");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.txt");
```

##### 2. Initialize the Converter
Create an instance of the `Converter` class, passing the path to your TIFF file.
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(sourceTiffPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

##### 3. Set Conversion Options
Specify the conversion options for TXT format using `TextConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var convertOptions = new TextConvertOptions();
```

##### 4. Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the result to the specified path.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputPath, convertOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found**: Ensure that your file paths are correct.
- **Conversion Errors**: Check if the TIFF file is accessible and properly formatted.
- **Memory Issues**: Monitor resource usage during conversion for large files.

## Practical Applications
Understanding how to apply this feature can enhance various processes:
1. **Document Digitization**: Convert scanned documents into editable text formats for easier data manipulation.
