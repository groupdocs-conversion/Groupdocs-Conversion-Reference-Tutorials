        using (var converter = new Converter(DocumentPath))
        {
            var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex };
            string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "epub-converted-to.tex");
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options);

    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: EPUB to TEX Conversion

The core functionality we're focusing on is converting an EPUB file into a TEX format using GroupDocs.Conversion. This feature is essential for those who need to convert e-books or similar documents into formats suitable for typesetting.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define Paths**

Begin by defining the paths for your source EPUB document and the output directory where the converted TEX file will be saved.

```csharp
const string DocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.epub";
const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Load the Source File**

Create an instance of the `Converter` class to load your EPUB document:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(DocumentPath))
{
    // Conversion code will be placed here.
}
```

**3. Set Conversion Options**

Specify that you want to convert the file into TEX format by setting up the conversion options:

```csharp
var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex };
```

**4. Execute Conversion**

Perform the actual conversion and save the output file in TEX format:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "epub-converted-to.tex");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your document paths are correct.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is correctly installed.
- Check for any exceptions thrown during the conversion process and handle them appropriately.
