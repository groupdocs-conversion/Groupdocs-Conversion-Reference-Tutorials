## Implementation Guide

### Converting WMZ to TXT

This feature allows you to convert a WMZ file into a TXT format, which can be more easily processed or analyzed.

#### Overview
The following steps will guide you through the conversion process:
1. **Load the WMZ File**: Open your source WMZ file using GroupDocs.Conversion.
2. **Configure Conversion Options**: Set the target format to TXT.
3. **Execute and Save**: Perform the conversion and save it as a text file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**Loading the Source WMZ File**
```csharp
// Define output folder and file path
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "wmz-converted-to.txt");

using (var converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.wmz"))
{
    // Proceed to configure conversion options
}
```
**Configuring Conversion Options**
```csharp
// Configure conversion options for Word Processing to TXT format
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```
**Executing the Conversion**
```csharp
// Execute the conversion and save the output as a text file
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Parameters & Configuration
- **Output Path**: Specify where you want to save your converted file.
- **Options Class**: This allows you to set various parameters like format type.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the WMZ file path is correct and accessible.
- Check for sufficient permissions on the output directory.

## Practical Applications
