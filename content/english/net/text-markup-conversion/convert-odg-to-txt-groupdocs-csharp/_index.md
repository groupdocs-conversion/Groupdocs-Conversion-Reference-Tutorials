namespace OdgToTxtConverter
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the converter with an ODG file path.
            using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.odg"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion initialized successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's walk through converting your ODG files to TXT step by step.

### Loading and Converting an ODG File

#### Overview
This section focuses on loading an ODG file and converting it into plain text format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

##### Step 1: Define Paths
Start by specifying the paths for your source ODG file and output TXT file:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.odg");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "odg-converted-to.txt");
```

##### Step 2: Initialize Converter
Create a new `Converter` object to manage the conversion process:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here.
}
```

##### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Define the TXT format options for conversion. This includes specifying that you want to convert to plain text:

```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```

##### Step 4: Execute Conversion
Finally, perform the actual file conversion and save it as a TXT file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion complete!");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File not found errors often occur if paths are incorrect. Double-check your directory names and file extensions.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that the application has read/write access to the specified directories.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET offers versatile applications across various scenarios:
1. **Document Archiving**: Convert legacy ODG files into text format for archival purposes.
2. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Integrate conversion capabilities within CMS platforms to handle diverse file types.
3. **Data Processing Pipelines**: Automate the transformation of graphic documents into text data for analysis.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Memory Management**: Ensure efficient memory usage by disposing of objects promptly with `using` statements.
