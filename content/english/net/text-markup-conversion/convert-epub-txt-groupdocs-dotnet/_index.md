var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("path/to/your/input.epub");
```

This setup will prepare you to start converting documents.

## Implementation Guide

### Convert EPUB to TXT

Let's explore the specific steps required to convert an EPUB file to a TXT format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Overview
The feature allows seamless conversion of e-books or documents from EPUB to plain text, facilitating easier data processing and analysis.

#### Step 1: Set Up File Paths

Define the paths for your input EPUB file and output TXT file:

```csharp
const string DocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(DocumentDirectory, "sample.epub");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "epub-converted-to.txt");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter Object

Create a `Converter` object with the source EPUB file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion code will be added here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

Set conversion options for TXT format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`:

```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```

This configuration specifies that the output file should be in TXT format.

#### Step 4: Perform Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the result as a TXT file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
```

**Explanation:** This method converts the specified EPUB document to a TXT file using the provided options. The `Convert` function handles processing and saving the output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your input EPUB path is correct.
- Check for any permissions issues with directories or files.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion version 25.3.0 or later is installed properly.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where converting EPUB to TXT can be beneficial:

1. **Text Analysis**: Extract text from e-books for natural language processing tasks.
2. **Data Migration**: Move content between different platforms that support only plain text formats.
3. **Accessibility**: Provide a simplified version of documents for screen readers.

These applications demonstrate how this feature integrates with broader .NET systems and frameworks, such as ASP.NET or desktop applications.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips
- Batch processing can enhance performance when converting multiple files.
- Monitor memory usage to ensure efficient resource management during conversions.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management
- Dispose of `Converter` objects properly using the `using` statement to free up resources immediately after conversion.

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll maintain optimal application performance while utilizing GroupDocs.Conversion.
