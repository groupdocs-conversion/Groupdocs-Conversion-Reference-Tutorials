### Convert JPEG 2000 File to LaTeX Format
#### Overview
This feature allows you to convert JPEG 2000 files into LaTeX documents, ideal for preparing high-quality images for typesetting or academic publishing.

##### Step 1: Define Paths and Initialize Converter
- **Purpose**: Set the source and destination paths.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```csharp
  string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.j2k");
  string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
  string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "j2k-converted-to.tex");

  using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
  ```

##### Step 2: Set Conversion Options

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```csharp
  var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex };
  ```

##### Step 3: Execute Conversion
- **Purpose**: Perform the conversion and save the output file.
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```csharp
  converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
  ```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that `documentPath` points to a valid J2K file.
- Verify that `outputFolder` exists or create it programmatically if needed.

## Practical Applications
Converting JPEG 2000 files to LaTeX is beneficial in several scenarios:
