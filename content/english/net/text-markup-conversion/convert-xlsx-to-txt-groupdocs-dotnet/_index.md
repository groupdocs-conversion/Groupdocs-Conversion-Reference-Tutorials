## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Load and Convert XLSX to TXT

#### Overview
This feature allows you to load an Excel file in XLSX format and convert it into a text file using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This is particularly useful when processing data from spreadsheets in environments where only text files are supported.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

##### 1. Define Output Directory and File Path
Set the path for your output TXT file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
File outputFile = new File(outputFolder, "xlsx-converted-to.txt");
```

##### 2. Load the XLSX Document
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your XLSX file:

```csharp
try (Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLSX")) {
    // Conversion logic will go here
} catch (Exception e) {
    Console.WriteLine("Error during conversion: " + e.Message);
}
```

##### 3. Set Conversion Options for TXT Format
Configure the conversion settings to target TXT format:

```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
options.setFormat(WordProcessingFileType.Txt);
```

##### 4. Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.convert(outputFile.getPath(), options);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that the paths to your input XLSX and output TXT files are correct.
- Verify that you have necessary permissions to read/write files in specified directories.
