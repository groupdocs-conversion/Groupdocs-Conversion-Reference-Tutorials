Once installed, initialize and configure GroupDocs.Conversion as follows:

```csharp
// Import necessary namespaces
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Define your source OXPS file path
cstring sourceOxpsFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.oxps";
```

## Implementation Guide
### Step 1: Load Source OXPS File
Load an OXPS document to prepare it for conversion.

```csharp
// Define a constant for the input file path
cstring sourceOxpsFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.oxps";

// Load the source OXPS file
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceOxpsFilePath))
{
    // The 'converter' object now holds the loaded OXPS document and is ready for conversion.
}
```

### Step 2: Convert OXPS to TEX Format
Convert the loaded OXPS file into TEX format.

```csharp
// Define output directory and file path
cstring outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
cstring outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "oxps-converted-to.tex");

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceOxpsFilePath))
{
    // Configure conversion options for TEX format
    PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions {
        Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex 
    };
    
    // Perform the conversion and save the output to the specified file path
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Errors**: Verify your file paths are correct and permissions are set.
- **Format Issues**: Check if additional options need adjustment for complex documents.
