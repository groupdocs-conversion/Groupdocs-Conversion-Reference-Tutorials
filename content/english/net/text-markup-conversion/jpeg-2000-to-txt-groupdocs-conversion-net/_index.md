    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's walk through the conversion process step-by-step.

### Load and Convert J2C to TXT

#### Overview
This feature shows how to load a JPEG 2000 (.j2c) file and convert it into plain text (.txt) format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory
Define the output directory path:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "j2c-converted-to.txt");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source J2C File
Load your source file using the Converter class provided by GroupDocs:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_J2C"))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Set options to target TXT format, specifying necessary output parameters:
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```

#### Step 4: Execute the Conversion
Perform the conversion and save the result in your specified path:
```csharp
csv
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure the source J2C file exists at the specified path.
- Verify write permissions to the output directory.

## Practical Applications

Converting J2C files to TXT can be useful in:
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract text data from archived images for analysis or reporting.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Convert image-based documents into editable formats for easier management.
3. **Integration with Other .NET Systems**: Seamlessly integrate this process within larger document processing pipelines.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage during conversions, especially in batch processes.
- **Best Practices for Memory Management**: Dispose of objects properly to free up resources immediately after use.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("SOURCE_FILE"))
{
    // Conversion logic here
}
```
