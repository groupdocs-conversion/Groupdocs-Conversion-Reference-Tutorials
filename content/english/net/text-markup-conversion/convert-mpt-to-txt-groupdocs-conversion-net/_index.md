# How to Convert MPT Files to TXT Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Do you need a reliable way to convert Microsoft Project Template (MPT) files into plain text format? Whether it's for data extraction, simplifying content sharing, or making project data more accessible, converting MPT files is essential. This tutorial guides you through using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to efficiently transform your MPT files into TXT format.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
- The steps to load an MPT file and convert it to a TXT file
- Best practices for optimizing performance with this library

By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped to handle your conversion needs like a pro. Let’s start by setting up the necessary environment.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into implementation, ensure you have:

- **Required Libraries**: GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (Version 25.3.0)
- **Environment Setup**: A working C# development environment like Visual Studio
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of C# and file handling concepts

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

#### License Acquisition

To use GroupDocs.Conversion, you can start with a free trial or acquire a temporary license for evaluation purposes. For production environments, consider purchasing a full license.

- **Free Trial**: Access basic functionalities to test the library.
- **Temporary License**: Extend your testing period without limitations.
- **Purchase**: Obtain a full license for long-term use.

#### Basic Initialization

Initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project with this setup:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Initialize the converter with the path to your MPT file.
string mptFilePath = "path/to/sample.mpt";
using (var converter = new Converter(mptFilePath))
{
    // Code for conversion will go here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Convert MPT File to TXT

Follow these steps to load an MPT file and convert it into a TXT format.

#### Step 1: Define Directory Paths

Start by defining paths for your input document and output directory:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Define the path to your source MPT file and output TXT file.
string mptFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mpt");
string txtOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mpt-converted-to.txt");
```

#### Step 2: Load the MPT File

Use the `Converter` class from GroupDocs.Conversion to load your MPT file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(mptFilePath))
{
    // Conversion will be performed here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options

Specify conversion options for transforming an MPT into a TXT format:

```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt 
};
```

**Explanation**: The `WordProcessingConvertOptions` allows you to define the target file type. Here, we set it to `Txt`.

#### Step 4: Perform Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output:

```csharp
converter.Convert(txtOutputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue**: Missing files or incorrect paths.
  - Ensure that all file paths are correctly specified and accessible.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for converting MPT to TXT using GroupDocs.Conversion:

1. **Data Sharing**: Simplify sharing project data with non-Microsoft users by providing a plain text format.
