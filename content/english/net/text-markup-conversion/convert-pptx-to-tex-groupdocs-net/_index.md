## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert PPTX to TEX

**Overview**

This feature allows seamless conversion of PowerPoint presentations into LaTeX documents using the GroupDocs.Conversion library. Here are the steps:

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pptx"; // Path to your PPTX file.
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Output directory for TEX files.
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pptx-converted-to.tex"); // Full path to the output TEX file.
```

**Explanation**: Specify paths using placeholders. Replace them with actual directories in your environment.

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the PPTX File
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex };
    
    // Convert and save the TEX file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation**: 
- **Converter Class**: Initializes with your PPTX file.
- **PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions**: Configures conversion settings specifically for TEX format.
- **converter.Convert Method**: Executes the conversion process.
