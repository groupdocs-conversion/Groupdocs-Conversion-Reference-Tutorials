# Convert DICOM Medical Images to PDF

## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to seamlessly convert file formats is paramount. Whether it's for archiving, sharing, or simply viewing, the need to convert files from one format to another is a common task. One such conversion that often arises in the medical field is the conversion of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) images to PDF format. DICOM files are the standard format used for medical imaging, storing information such as MRI scans, X-rays, and CT scans.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the process of converting DICOM images to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, there are a few prerequisites to ensure a smooth experience:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Firstly, ensure you have the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) provided by GroupDocs.
### 2. Obtain DICOM Image Files
You'll need access to the DICOM image files that you wish to convert. These files typically contain medical imaging data and can be obtained from medical imaging devices or databases.
### 3. Set Up a .NET Development Environment
Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine. This includes having a compatible IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Visual Studio installed.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin coding the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods from the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dicom-converted-to.pdf");
```
In this step, we specify the directory where we want the converted PDF file to be saved and define the name of the output PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source DICOM File
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_DICOM))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Here, we initialize a new instance of the `Converter` class provided by GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, passing the path of the source DICOM file as a parameter.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
PdfConvertOptions options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
In this step, we create an instance of the `PdfConvertOptions` class to specify any additional options for the PDF conversion process. This allows customization according to specific requirements.
## Step 4: Perform Conversion and Save PDF File
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Finally, we call the `Convert` method of the `Converter` class, passing the output file path and conversion options as parameters. This executes the conversion process and saves the resulting PDF file to the specified location.
