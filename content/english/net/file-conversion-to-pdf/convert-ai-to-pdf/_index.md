# Convert AI Files to PDF

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to leverage the power of GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert AI files to PDF format. We'll break down the process into simple, actionable steps, ensuring that even beginners can follow along with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on our journey of converting AI files to PDF, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to have in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
First and foremost, you'll need to have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the necessary files from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Obtain a Source AI File
Ensure you have the AI file that you want to convert to PDF readily available in your document directory.
### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have a working development environment set up for .NET programming, including a code editor such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces
To begin our conversion process, we need to import the necessary namespaces into our .NET project. This allows us to access the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Conversion effortlessly.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
This line of code imports the GroupDocs.Conversion namespace, giving us access to the Converter class and other essential components.
## Step 1: Load the Source AI File
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ai-converted-to.pdf");
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path to Your AI File"))
{
```
In this step, we specify the output folder where the converted PDF will be saved and provide a name for the output PDF file. Then, we initialize a new instance of the Converter class, passing the path to our source AI file as an argument.
## Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
	var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Here, we create a new instance of PdfConvertOptions to specify any additional settings for the PDF conversion. This step is optional but allows for customization according to specific requirements.
## Step 3: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
	converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
In this final step, we call the Convert method of the Converter instance, passing the output file path and any conversion options. This triggers the conversion process, wherein the AI file is converted to PDF format and saved in the specified output directory.

In conclusion, GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET provides a robust solution for converting AI files to PDF format seamlessly. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effortlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, thereby enhancing document management capabilities and streamlining workflows.
