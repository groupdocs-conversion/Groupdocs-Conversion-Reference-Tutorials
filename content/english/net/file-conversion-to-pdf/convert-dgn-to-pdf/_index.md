# Convert DGN CAD Files to PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of software development, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is paramount. Whether it's for data migration, compatibility reasons, or simply for ease of use, having robust conversion tools at your disposal can make a world of difference. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of converting DGN CAD files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Make sure you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed and set up in your development environment. You can download the library from the [GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Access to DGN CAD Files
You'll need access to the DGN CAD files that you intend to convert. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and manipulate these files.

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with the conversion, import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for file conversion.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Path
First, specify the folder where you want the converted PDF file to be saved, and define the output file path.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dgn-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source DGN File
Next, load the source DGN file that you intend to convert into PDF format.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_DGN))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_DGN` with the path to your source DGN file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options according to your requirements. For converting DGN to PDF, we'll use `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Now, initiate the conversion process and save the converted PDF file using the specified options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
Finally, inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the path to the output folder.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.\nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
