# Convert DOTX Word Templates to PDF

## Introduction
Microsoft Word documents are widely used for various purposes, including creating templates in DOTX format. However, there might be instances where you need to convert these DOTX templates to PDF for easier sharing, printing, or archival purposes. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of converting DOTX Word templates to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library: Download and install the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Source DOTX File: You'll need a DOTX file that you want to convert to PDF. Ensure you have the path to this file ready for the conversion process.

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with the conversion, ensure you import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Set Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dotx-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure you specify the directory where you want to save the converted PDF file and define the name for the output file.
## Step 2: Load the Source DOTX File and Convert
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_DOTX))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
Initialize a new instance of the `Converter` class by passing the path to the source DOTX file. Then, configure the conversion options, specifying that you want to convert to PDF. Finally, call the `Convert` method to perform the conversion.
## Step 3: Check Conversion Completion
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
After the conversion process completes successfully, display a message indicating the completion and the location where the converted PDF file can be found.
