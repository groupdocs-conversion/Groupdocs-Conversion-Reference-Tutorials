## Introduction
In the realm of document management, converting files from one format to another is often a necessity. Whether it's for compatibility reasons, archiving purposes, or simply preference, being able to seamlessly convert between formats is crucial. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to convert DOCX Word documents to PDF effortlessly using the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET. By following these step-by-step instructions, you'll be equipped to handle such conversions with ease.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Make sure you have the library installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you have a working knowledge of .NET development and have the necessary environment set up.

## Import Namespaces
To begin, let's import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File
Firstly, specify the output folder where you want the converted PDF file to be saved, and define the output file name:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "docx-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load Source DOCX File
Next, load the source DOCX file using the GroupDocs.Conversion library:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_DOCX))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_DOCX` with the path to your source DOCX file.
## Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Define the conversion options. In this case, we'll use PdfConvertOptions since we're converting to PDF:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform Conversion
Perform the actual conversion and save the converted PDF file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Finally, notify the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
