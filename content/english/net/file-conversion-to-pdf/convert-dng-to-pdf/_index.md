## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of converting DNG images to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. DNG (Digital Negative) is a file format used for digital photography. By converting DNG images to PDF, you can easily share or store them in a more universally accepted format.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Download and install the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Source DNG File: You need a DNG image file that you want to convert to PDF.
3. Development Environment: Ensure you have a .NET development environment set up.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your project. Add the following using directives to your code file:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Load the Source DNG File
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dng-converted-to.pdf");
// Load the source DNG file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_DNG))
{
    // Continue with the conversion process
}
```
In this step, you define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your desired directory. Then, you specify the name and path of the output PDF file.
## Step 2: Convert DNG to PDF
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
// Save converted PDF file
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Here, you create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions` to set any specific options for the PDF conversion, if required. Then, you call the `Convert` method of the `converter` object, passing the output file path and conversion options.
## Step 3: Handle Conversion Completion
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
After the conversion process is completed, you display a success message along with the directory where the converted PDF file is located.
