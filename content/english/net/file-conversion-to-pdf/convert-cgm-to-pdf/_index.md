In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of converting CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) vector graphics to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. CGM is a file format used for vector graphics, commonly utilized in technical drawings, illustrations, and other graphical applications.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

2. CGM File: Prepare the CGM file that you want to convert to PDF. You can obtain sample CGM files from various sources or create your own.

## Import Namespaces
First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods for conversion.
```csharp

using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Set Output Folder and File Name
Define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved, and specify the name of the output PDF file.

string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "cgm-converted-to.pdf");
```
## Step 2: Load the Source CGM File

    // Step 3: Convert CGM to PDF
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
## Step 4: Check Conversion Status
