## Introduction
Microsoft Word DOTM templates, often containing macros, can pose compatibility issues across different platforms or applications. Converting them to PDF format not only ensures universal accessibility but also eliminates potential security risks associated with macros. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to convert DOTM files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Install GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/). 
2. Sample DOTM File: Obtain a sample DOTM file to perform the conversion.

## Import Namespaces
First, make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Load the Source DOTM File
Load the DOTM file that you intend to convert to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("path_to_your_dotm_file.dotm"))
{
    // Your code for conversion will go here
}
```
Replace `"path_to_your_dotm_file.dotm"` with the actual path to your DOTM file.
## Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Specify the conversion options, particularly for converting to PDF. For example, you can set options like page orientation, margin, resolution, etc.:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
// Customize conversion options here if needed
```
## Step 3: Perform Conversion and Save PDF
Now, perform the conversion and save the resulting PDF file:
```csharp
// Save converted PDF file
converter.Convert("output_path.pdf", options);
```
Replace `"output_path.pdf"` with the desired output path for the converted PDF file.
## Step 4: Handle Conversion Completion
Handle the completion of the conversion process. For example, you can display a message indicating successful completion:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.");
Console.WriteLine("Check output in your specified output folder.");
```
