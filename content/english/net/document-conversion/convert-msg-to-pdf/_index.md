## Introduction
In today's digital age, document conversion plays a crucial role in managing and sharing information efficiently. Whether you're a developer building applications or an organization streamlining your workflow, having the ability to convert files from one format to another is invaluable. In this tutorial, we'll delve into converting MSG (Outlook Message Format) files to PDF (Portable Document Format) using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. .NET Development Environment Setup
Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up on your machine. You can download and install the necessary tools from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
### 2. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library
Download and install the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 3. Sample MSG File
Prepare a sample MSG file that you want to convert to PDF. Ensure you have its file path ready for the conversion process.

## Import Namespaces
Before we dive into the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "msg-converted-to.pdf");
```
Here, we define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path.
## Step 2: Load the Source MSG File and Convert to PDF
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_MSG))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Save converted PDF file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
In this step, we initialize the GroupDocs.Conversion Converter class with the path to the MSG file. Then, we specify conversion options for PDF format. Finally, we execute the conversion process and save the converted PDF file to the output folder.
## Step 3: Display Conversion Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
After the conversion is completed, this step displays a success message along with the path where the converted PDF file is saved.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert MSG files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites, you can efficiently manage your document conversions within your .NET applications.
