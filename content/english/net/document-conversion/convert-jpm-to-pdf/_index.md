### Environment Setup
1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Begin by downloading the library from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) and following the installation instructions provided.
2. .NET Framework: Ensure you have the appropriate version of the .NET Framework installed on your system to run GroupDocs.Conversion.
3. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment, whether it's Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.

## Import Namespaces
To start using GroupDocs.Conversion in your .NET application, you need to import the necessary namespaces. Let's break down this step:

1. Add GroupDocs.Conversion Namespace: Begin by importing the GroupDocs.Conversion namespace into your project. This namespace contains all the essential classes and methods for file conversion.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

Now that we have the prerequisites in place and the necessary namespaces imported, let's dive into the step-by-step process of converting a JPM file to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET:

## Step 1: Specify Output Folder
Define the folder where you want the converted PDF file to be saved.

```
## Step 2: Define Output File Path
Combine the output folder path with the desired name for the converted PDF file.
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jpm-converted-to.pdf");
```
## Step 3: Load Source JPM File
Initialize the GroupDocs.Conversion Converter object with the path to the source JPM file.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_JPM))
```
## Step 4: Specify Conversion Options
Optionally, you can specify conversion options based on your requirements. In this case, we're converting to PDF, so we'll use PdfConvertOptions.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 5: Perform Conversion
Execute the conversion process by calling the Convert method of the Converter object and passing the output file path along with the conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 6: Display Success Message
