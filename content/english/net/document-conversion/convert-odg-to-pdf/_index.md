## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Firstly, you need to download and install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/). Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library correctly.
### 2. Obtain Source ODG File
Ensure you have the ODG file that you want to convert to PDF ready and accessible from your development environment.
### 3. Set up Development Environment
Make sure you have a suitable development environment set up with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed, depending on your project requirements.

## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, you need to import the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Conversion functionality effectively.

Include the GroupDocs.Conversion namespace in your code file to access the conversion functionalities.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps to guide you through the entire procedure.
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Path
Begin by specifying the output folder and the desired name for the converted PDF file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "odg-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source ODG File
Load the source ODG file that you intend to convert to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_ODG))
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_ODG` with the path to your source ODG file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options according to your requirements. In this case, we're converting ODG to PDF, so we'll use PdfConvertOptions.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
You can customize conversion options based on your specific needs, such as setting page orientation, adjusting margins, or specifying image quality.
## Step 4: Perform Conversion and Save PDF File
Execute the conversion process and save the converted PDF file to the specified output path.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
