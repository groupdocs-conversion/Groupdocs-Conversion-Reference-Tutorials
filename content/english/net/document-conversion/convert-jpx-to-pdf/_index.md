## Introduction
In the realm of document manipulation and conversion, GroupDocs offers a powerful toolset for developers to seamlessly integrate conversion functionalities into their .NET applications. One such task is converting JPX files to PDF format using the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET. This tutorial will guide you through the process, breaking down each step to ensure clarity and understanding.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Install the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. JPX File: Have a sample JPX file ready for conversion.
3. Development Environment: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any other .NET-supported IDE.

## Import Namespaces
Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the GroupDocs.Conversion functionalities in your code. Follow these steps:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jpx-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source JPX File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_JPX))
{
```
Here, `Constants.SAMPLE_JPX` represents the path to your JPX file. Make sure to replace it with the actual file path.
## Step 3: Define Conversion Options
```csharp
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
In this step, we instantiate `PdfConvertOptions` to specify options for PDF conversion. You can customize conversion options according to your requirements.
## Step 4: Perform Conversion
```csharp
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Execute the conversion process by calling the `Convert` method of the `Converter` class, passing the output file path and conversion options as parameters.
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
```csharp
    Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
After successful conversion, a message is displayed confirming the completion and indicating the location where the converted PDF file is saved.

## Conclusion
