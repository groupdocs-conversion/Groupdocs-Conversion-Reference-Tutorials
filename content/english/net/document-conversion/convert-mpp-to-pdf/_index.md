## Introduction
In today's digital age, the need to convert files from one format to another is becoming increasingly common. Whether you're a developer, a business professional, or an individual user, having the ability to seamlessly convert files can save time and improve productivity. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to convert MPP (Microsoft Project) files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
To get started, you need to have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Obtain a License or Use a Temporary License
To use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, you'll need a license. You can either purchase a license from the [website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or utilize a temporary license available [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
### 3. Familiarity with C# and .NET Environment
Basic knowledge of C# programming language and the .NET environment is necessary to follow along with this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces
Before we start the conversion process, we need to import the necessary namespaces in our C# code:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Name
First, specify the directory where you want to save the converted PDF file and provide a name for the output file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mpp-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your desired output directory.
## Step 2: Load the Source MPP File
Next, load the source MPP file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_MPP))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Make sure to replace `Constants.SAMPLE_MPP` with the path to your source MPP file.
## Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Define the conversion options, in this case, we're converting to PDF format:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Now, execute the conversion process and save the converted PDF file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Output Confirmation
Finally, display a message confirming the successful completion of the conversion process and the location of the converted PDF file:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
