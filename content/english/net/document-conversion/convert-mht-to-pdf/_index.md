# Convert MHT to PDF

## Introduction
In the world of .NET development, converting files from one format to another is a common task. Whether you're dealing with documents, images, or other types of files, having the ability to seamlessly convert between formats can be incredibly valuable. One powerful tool that enables this functionality is GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
In this tutorial, we'll focus on one specific conversion task: converting MHT (MIME HTML) files to PDF (Portable Document Format) using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. We'll walk through the process step by step, breaking down each example into manageable chunks to ensure a clear understanding.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library: Ensure that you have the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: You'll need a working environment for .NET development, including Visual Studio or any other IDE of your choice.
3. Basic Understanding of C#: This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of C# programming language.
4. Sample MHT File: Prepare a sample MHT file that you'll use for conversion. You can use any MHT file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces
To get started with the conversion process, you need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# code. These namespaces provide access to the functionalities required for file conversion.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output File Location
First, define the location where you want to save the converted PDF file. This will be the directory where your document is stored.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mht-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your desired output directory.
## Step 2: Load the Source MHT File
Next, you need to load the source MHT file that you want to convert. This step initializes the GroupDocs.Conversion converter with the specified MHT file.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_MHT))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Make sure to replace `Constants.SAMPLE_MHT` with the path to your MHT file.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
In this step, you'll set the conversion options. For converting MHT to PDF, you'll use `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Now, it's time to perform the actual conversion from MHT to PDF. Use the `Convert()` method of the converter object and pass the output file path along with the conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Finally, display a success message indicating that the conversion process has been completed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the process of converting MHT files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and utilizing the provided code snippets, you can seamlessly integrate file conversion functionality into your .NET applications.
