### Source MHTML File

## Import Namespaces

## Step 2: Load the Source MHTML File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path_To_Your_MHTML_File"))
{
    // Conversion options setup will be added in the next step
}
```
Replace `"Path_To_Your_MHTML_File"` with the actual path to your source MHTML file.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
