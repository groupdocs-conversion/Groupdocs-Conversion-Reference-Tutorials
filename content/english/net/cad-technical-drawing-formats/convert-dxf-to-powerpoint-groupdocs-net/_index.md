}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the conversion process into clear steps.

### Load and Convert a DXF File to PPT

**Overview:**
This section shows how to load a DXF file and convert it into a PowerPoint presentation using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

Start by defining where your converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dxf-converted-to.ppt");
```

#### Step 2: Load the DXF Source File

Load the DXF file using the `Converter` class to initialize conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your-dxf-file.dxf")))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Conversion Options

Specify that you want to convert your file to PowerPoint format:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Execute the Conversion

Perform the conversion and save the output file.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Key Configuration Options:**
- **OutputFormat**: Set this within `PresentationConvertOptions` to define the exact PowerPoint format (e.g., PPTX).

### Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues you might encounter include:
- **Incorrect File Paths**: Ensure all directory paths are correctly specified.
- **License Errors**: Verify your license is properly set up if encountering access restrictions.
