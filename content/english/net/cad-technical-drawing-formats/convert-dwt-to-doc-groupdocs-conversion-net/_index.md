class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize a license if available
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");

## Implementation Guide
### Convert DWT to DOC
Now, let's dive into the core functionality—converting a DWT file to a DOC format.

#### Overview of What This Feature Accomplishes
This feature allows you to programmatically convert DWT files (commonly used by CorelDRAW) into DOC format, making them accessible in Microsoft Word applications. 

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1: Define File Paths**
Start by specifying the source DWT file and the output directory for the converted DOC.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string sourceDwtPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\\\sample.dwt";
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dwt-converted-to.doc");
```

**Step 2: Load the DWT File**
Load your DWT file using the `Converter` class. This step prepares the document for conversion.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceDwtPath))
{
    // Proceed to convert
}
```

**Step 3: Configure Conversion Options**
Set up the options to specify DOC as the output format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.
```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc 
};
```

**Step 4: Perform the Conversion and Save**
Finally, execute the conversion and save the output file.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issues**: Ensure the source DWT path is correct. Incorrect paths will lead to `FileNotFoundException`.
- **License Errors**: Double-check your license setup if you encounter access restrictions.
- **Output Format**: If the DOC format isn't recognized, verify that the version of GroupDocs.Conversion supports it.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be integrated into various real-world scenarios:
1. **Automating Document Workflows**: Automatically convert design files to editable text documents for content teams.
2. **Archiving Legacy Files**: Convert older document formats used by legacy systems into more modern, accessible formats.
3. **Cross-Platform Sharing**: Facilitate sharing between different platforms and software that require specific file types.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance during conversions:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects promptly to free up memory resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Convert files in batches if dealing with large volumes, to manage resource consumption effectively.
- **Use Latest Versions**: Always update to the latest version of GroupDocs.Conversion for improved stability and features.
