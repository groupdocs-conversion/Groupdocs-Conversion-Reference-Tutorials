**What You'll Learn:**
- Basics of DWFX to SVG conversion
- How to set up and use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
- Key code implementation steps with clear explanations
- Real-world applications

Let's begin by setting up the necessary prerequisites!

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you'll need:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
Ensure your project includes GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET version 25.3.0.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment set up with Visual Studio or any IDE supporting .NET projects.
- Basic knowledge of C# and file handling in .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

### Installation Instructions

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps
You can start with a free trial to evaluate the features of GroupDocs.Conversion. For extended use, consider acquiring a temporary license or purchasing a subscription from their official site.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how you can initialize and set up your project in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        string dwfxFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.dwfx");

        // Initialize the converter
        using (Converter converter = new Converter(dwfxFilePath))
        {
            var options = new MarkupConvertOptions();
            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.svg");
            
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet demonstrates the basic setup and conversion process. The `Converter` class is initialized with your DWFX file path, which then gets converted to SVG using `MarkupConvertOptions`.
