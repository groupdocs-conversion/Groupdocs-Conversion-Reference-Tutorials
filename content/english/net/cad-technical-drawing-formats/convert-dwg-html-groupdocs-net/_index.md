## Implementation Guide

### DWG to HTML Conversion Feature

This feature enables you to convert DWG files into HTML format, making them web-friendly. Let’s break down the steps:

#### Step 1: Configure Input and Output Directories

Firstly, define your document paths clearly:

string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with desired output directory
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source DWG File

Load your DWG file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.dwg")))
{
    // Proceed to conversion options
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options for HTML Format

Configure the necessary settings for HTML conversion with `WebConvertOptions`:

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Save the Converted HTML File

Finally, save your converted file in the specified output directory:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "dwg-converted-to.html");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
