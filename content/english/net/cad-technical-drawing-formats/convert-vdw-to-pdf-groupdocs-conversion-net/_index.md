```
## Implementation Guide
### Feature 1: Convert VDW File to PDF (H2)
This feature demonstrates converting a Visio Web Drawing file into Portable Document Format.
#### Step 1: Define Directories and Load the Source VDW File (H3)
Start by specifying your document directory and output directory. Ensure these paths are consistent and accessible from your application:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

// Define directories using placeholder paths.
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\";

// Load the VDW file using the Converter class.
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.vdw")))
{
    // Proceed to configure PDF conversion options.
}
```
#### Step 2: Configure PDF Conversion Options (H3)
Set up your conversion parameters by creating an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`:
```csharp
// Configure PDF conversion options
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
These options allow you to customize the output, such as setting margins or adding watermarks.
#### Step 3: Define Output File Path and Convert (H3)
Specify where your converted file will be saved, then execute the conversion:
```csharp
// Define the output file path.
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "vdw-converted-to.pdf");

// Execute the conversion process.
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
**Troubleshooting Tips**: Ensure directories exist and have proper write permissions. Check for exceptions during conversion to handle specific errors.
### Feature 2: File Path Configuration (H2)
This feature sets up consistent paths for input documents and output files, crucial for maintaining organized code:
```csharp
using System.IO;

// Define placeholders for document and output directories.
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\";
```
Ensure these paths are dynamically set based on your project's structure to avoid hardcoding issues.
