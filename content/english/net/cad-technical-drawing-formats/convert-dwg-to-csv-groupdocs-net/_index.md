Start with a free trial or request a temporary license for full API access. Purchasing unlocks more extensive capabilities and support.

Once installed, initialize the library in your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load DWG File

#### Overview
Loading a DWG file is the first step in the conversion process. This section demonstrates how to use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your source file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Set Up Source Path**
Begin by specifying the path to your DWG file:
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your-file.dwg");
```

**2. Load the File**
Use the `Converter` class to load your DWG file, ensuring resources are disposed of properly:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion steps will follow here.
}
```
*Note: Disposing of objects efficiently frees system resources.*

### Configure Conversion Options for CSV

#### Overview
This section covers setting up conversion options specifically tailored for generating a CSV file.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Create Conversion Options**
Define the output format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:
```csharp
var csvOptions = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions
{
    Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Csv // Set the desired format to CSV
};
```

### Convert DWG to CSV

#### Overview
Now, let's perform the conversion from DWG to CSV.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Output Path**
Ensure you have an output directory ready:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dwg-converted-to.csv");
```

**2. Execute Conversion**
Within the `using` block where your DWG file is loaded, perform the conversion:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, csvOptions);
```
*This method will convert and save the DWG data into a CSV format.*

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that your source directory paths are correctly set.
- Verify appropriate write permissions for your output folder.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Conversion can be integrated with various .NET systems to automate CAD file processing. Here are some use cases:
1. **Data Export**: Extract DWG data into CSV for analysis or reporting.
2. **Interoperability**: Facilitate sharing of design specifications in a universally accessible format.
3. **Batch Processing**: Automate the conversion of multiple DWG files en masse.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- Minimize unnecessary conversions by pre-filtering data if possible.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects promptly after use.
- Utilize asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations where applicable.
