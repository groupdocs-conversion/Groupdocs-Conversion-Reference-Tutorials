### Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that your environment is properly set up. You'll need:
- **Libraries & Dependencies:** GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (Version 25.3.0)
- **Environment Setup:** A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and file handling in .NET

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To get started with GroupDocs.Conversion, you'll first need to install the library. Hereâ€™s how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers various licensing options, including a free trial, temporary licenses for testing, and full purchase options:
- **Free Trial:** Download and test the features with limitations.
- **Temporary License:** Apply for a no-cost license to evaluate all features without restrictions.
- **Purchase:** Buy a commercial license if you need long-term use of GroupDocs.Conversion.

Once you have your license, initialize it in your application as follows:

```csharp
GroupDocs.Conversion.License lic = new GroupDocs.Conversion.License();
lic.SetLicense("Path to License File.lic");
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert DGN File to TEX Format

This feature demonstrates converting a DGN file into TEX format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Load the Source DGN File

First, specify your document directory and output paths:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with desired output path
```

Load the DGN file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.dgn")))
{
    // Configure conversion options for TEX format
    PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions
    {
        Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex
    };
    
    // Set the output file path and perform conversion
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "dgn-converted-to.tex");
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Converter Class:** Loads the DGN file for processing.
- **PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions:** Configures conversion settings specific to TEX format.
- **Output File Path:** Specifies where the converted file should be saved.

#### Manage File Paths for Conversion

Ensure your input and output directories are set up correctly:

```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(documentDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(documentDirectory);
}

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure the DGN file (`sample.dgn`) is present in your document directory.
- Check for read/write permissions on the directories.

### Practical Applications

1. **CAD to Documentation:** Convert technical drawings into TEX files for documentation and reporting.
2. **Automated Workflows:** Integrate conversion processes within automated workflows using .NET services.
3. **Data Exchange:** Facilitate data exchange between different engineering platforms by converting file formats.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Memory Management:** Use `using` statements to release resources promptly.
- **Batch Processing:** Convert files in batches to manage resource usage efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization:** Profile your application to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to convert DGN files into TEX format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This guide covered setting up the library, implementing the conversion feature, managing file paths, and optimizing performance.
