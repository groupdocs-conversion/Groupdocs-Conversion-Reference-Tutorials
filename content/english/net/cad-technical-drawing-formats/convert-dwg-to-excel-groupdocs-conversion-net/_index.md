# How to Convert DWG Files to Excel Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to convert CAD files like DWG to a more accessible format such as Excel? Many professionals face the challenge of transforming DWG files into spreadsheets for easier data manipulation and sharing. **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** provides seamless conversion capabilities from DWG to XLS, making this task straightforward.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert your DWG files into Excel format efficiently. By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to utilize this powerful tool within your .NET applications effectively.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Loading and preparing your DWG file for conversion
- Configuring conversion options for XLS format
- Saving your converted files in Excel format
- Performance optimization tips when using GroupDocs.Conversion

Let's begin with the prerequisites needed before converting!

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**: Version 25.3.0 or later.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with file handling in .NET applications.

With these prerequisites covered, let's proceed to set up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET!

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Conversion, install it via NuGet Package Manager or the .NET CLI. Here’s how:

### Using NuGet Package Manager Console
Run this command in your package manager console:
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

### Using .NET CLI
Alternatively, use this command if you're working with .NET Core or later versions:
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

#### License Acquisition Steps
To fully utilize GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, consider acquiring a license. You can start with a free trial to explore its features, request a temporary license for full functionality during testing, or purchase a subscription.

Let's initialize and set up the environment in C#:
```csharp
// Ensure you have included the necessary using directives
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s break down the conversion process into manageable sections. Each section covers a specific feature of the conversion workflow.

### Load Source DWG File

#### Overview
The first step is to load your DWG file into the GroupDocs.Conversion library, preparing it for transformation.

#### Step 1: Define Input Path and Initialize Converter
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Specify the path to your source DWG file
cstring inputPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.dwg";

// Load the DWG file using GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter class
using (var converter = new Converter(inputPath))
{
    // The converter object is ready for conversion operations.
}
```
*Explanation*: Here, you define the path to your DWG file and create a `Converter` instance. This step loads the document into memory, enabling further processing.

### Configure Conversion Options for XLS Format

#### Overview
Configure how the DWG file should be converted into an Excel format by setting specific conversion options.

#### Step 2: Set Spreadsheet Convert Options
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Create a new instance of SpreadsheetConvertOptions and set the desired format to XLS
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };

// Now, your conversion settings are configured for XLS output.
```
*Explanation*: This code snippet initializes `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`, specifying that the output should be in XLS format. These options dictate how the DWG file will be transformed.

### Save Converted XLS File

#### Overview
Once you've set up the conversion process, save the resulting Excel file to your desired location.

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion and Save Output
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define output directory and path for the converted file
cstring outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
cstring outputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "dwg-converted-to.xls");

// Assuming 'converter' is already initialized with your DWG file
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.dwg"))
{
    // Convert and save the document using specified options
    converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
}

// Your converted XLS file is now saved in the specified output directory.
```
*Explanation*: This section handles the actual conversion and saving of your DWG file into an Excel format. It uses both previously defined `Converter` object and `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correctly defined and accessible.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
