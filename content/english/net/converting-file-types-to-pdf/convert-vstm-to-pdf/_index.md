## Import Namespaces
In order to utilize the functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, you need to import the required namespaces into your C# project. Follow these steps to import namespaces:

```

Now that you have the prerequisites in place and the required namespaces imported, let's dive into the step-by-step process of converting a VSTM file to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET:

```
## Step 2: Load the Source VSTM File
Load the source VSTM file using GroupDocs.Conversion. Provide the file path of the VSTM file that you want to convert.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_VSTM))
```
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options, specifying the desired output format. In this case, we're converting to PDF, so use `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Once the conversion is completed successfully, display a message indicating the completion along with the output folder location.
```csharp
