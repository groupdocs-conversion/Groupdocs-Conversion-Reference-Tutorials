In this tutorial, we'll delve into using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert XLAM files to PDF format effortlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Have the XLAM file that you want to convert to PDF readily available on your system. Ensure it's accessible from your .NET environment.
### 3. Basic Knowledge of C# Programming
Familiarize yourself with basic C# programming concepts to understand and implement the provided code snippets effectively.

## Import Namespaces
Before we proceed with the conversion, let's import the necessary namespaces to our C# code:
```csharp

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Paths
First, define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved and specify the output file name.

string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlam-converted-to.pdf");
```
## Step 2: Load the Source XLAM File

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_XLAM))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here
}
```
## Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Set up conversion options. In this case, we're converting to PDF format, so create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Invoke the `Convert` method on the converter object, passing the output file path and conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Conversion Status
