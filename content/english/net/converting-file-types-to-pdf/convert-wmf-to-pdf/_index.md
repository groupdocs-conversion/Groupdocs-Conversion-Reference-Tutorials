This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, ensuring that you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Import Namespaces
Before starting the conversion process, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "wmf-converted-to.pdf");
```
Firstly, specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Then, define the name of the output PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source WMF File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_WMF))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Create an instance of the `Converter` class by providing the path to the source WMF file within the constructor.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Instantiate the conversion options class specific to PDF conversion, in this case, `PdfConvertOptions`.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Invoke the `Convert` method of the converter instance, passing the output file path and conversion options as parameters. This executes the conversion process.
## Step 5: Display Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the path to the converted PDF file.
