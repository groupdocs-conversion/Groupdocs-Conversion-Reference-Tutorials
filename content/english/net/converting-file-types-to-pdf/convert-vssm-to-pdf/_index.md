First, let's import the necessary namespaces for our conversion task:

var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Now, let's perform the actual conversion and save the PDF file.
```csharp
// Save converted PDF file
converter.Convert("Your_Output_PDF_File_Path", options);
```
## Step 4: Display Completion Message
