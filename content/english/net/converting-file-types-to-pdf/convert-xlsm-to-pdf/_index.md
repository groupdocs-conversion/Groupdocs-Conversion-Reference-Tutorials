## Import Namespaces
First, let's import the necessary namespaces into our project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Path
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlsm-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source XLSM File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path_to_your_XLSM_file"))
{
	// Conversion logic will go here
}
```
Replace `"Path_to_your_XLSM_file"` with the actual path to your XLSM file.
## Step 3: Save the Converted PDF File
After setting up the conversion options, save the converted PDF file to the specified output path.
```csharp
// Conversion options
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();

// Perform conversion
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 4: Display Conversion Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This step notifies the user about the successful completion of the conversion process and provides the location where the converted PDF file can be found.
