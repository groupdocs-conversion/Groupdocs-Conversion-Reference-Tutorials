## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is paramount. Whether it's for sharing documents, archiving data, or simply ensuring compatibility across different platforms, having a reliable file conversion tool is essential. In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of converting VSS files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the conversion process, import the necessary namespaces to your project:
```csharp

Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your desired output directory.

{
    // Conversion code will be added here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_VSS` with the path to your VSS file.
## Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Define the conversion options, in this case, for converting to PDF format:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the converted PDF file using the defined options:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
