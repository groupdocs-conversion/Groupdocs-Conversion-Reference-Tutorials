string sourcePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.xlam"; // Replace with your actual XLAM file path
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlam-converted-to.html");

// Initialize the converter object
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourcePath))
{
    // Conversion options can be set here if needed
}
```

This sets up a basic framework for converting files.

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the conversion process into manageable steps to ensure clarity and ease of understanding.

### Converting XLAM to HTML

#### Overview:
The primary goal is to convert your .xlam file into an HTML document, which can be used in web applications or shared easily across different platforms.

##### Step 1: Load the Source XLAM File
Start by creating a `Converter` object with the path of your XLAM file. This object will handle all conversion processes.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourcePath))
{
    // Conversion logic here
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Conversion Options for HTML Format
Next, define how you want to convert the file by setting up `WebConvertOptions`. This will dictate the output format and any specific conversion settings.

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

##### Step 3: Save Converted HTML File
Finally, execute the conversion and save the resultant HTML file at your desired location.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **Common Issue:** If the file isn't found, verify that `sourcePath` is correctly set.
- **Permission Errors:** Ensure your application has permission to read from and write to specified directories.
