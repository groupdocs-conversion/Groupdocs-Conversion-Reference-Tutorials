## Implementation Guide

### Convert JPX File to HTML

This feature allows you to transform a JPEG 2000 Image File into an HTML format, enhancing web compatibility.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**Load the Source JPX File**

First, load your JPX file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class. This step is crucial for accessing the image data.

```csharp
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.jpx")))
{
    // Conversion process will be handled next.
}
```

**Configure HTML Conversion Options**

Use `WebConvertOptions` to specify how your JPX file should be converted.

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
// Additional configurations can be added here if needed.
```

**Perform the Conversion**

Execute the conversion and save the output to a specified location. This step finalizes the transformation process from JPX to HTML.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "jpx-converted-to.html");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
