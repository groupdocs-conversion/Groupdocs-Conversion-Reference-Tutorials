## Implementation Guide

### Convert EMZ to HTML

This feature focuses on converting an EMZ file into an accessible HTML document.

#### Step 1: Set Up File Paths

Define paths for your input EMZ file and output directory:

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "emz-converted-to.html");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source EMZ File

Use the `Converter` class to load your EMZ file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(emzFilePath))
{
    var options = new WebConvertOptions(); // HTML conversion options
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Perform the conversion
}
```

### Explanation of Code Parameters
