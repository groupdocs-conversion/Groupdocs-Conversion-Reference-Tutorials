## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the steps needed to convert a VSX file into HTML format.

### Load and Convert VSX File to HTML

#### Overview
This feature allows you to load a Visio (.vsx) file and transform it into an HTML document using GroupDocs.Conversion library, making it easily viewable in any web browser.

##### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Path
First, ensure the output directory exists. If not, create it:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ConvertedFiles");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vsx-converted-to.html");

// Ensure the output directory exists
if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
}
```

##### Step 2: Load the VSX File and Configure Conversion Options
Load your source file using the `Converter` class, then specify HTML as the target format:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.vsx")))
{
    // Configure conversion options for HTML format
    var options = new WebConvertOptions();
    
    // Perform the conversion and save to specified file path
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Converter Class:** Loads your VSX file.
- **WebConvertOptions:** Configures settings specifically for converting to web formats like HTML.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure that the source file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that all necessary permissions are in place for reading from and writing to directories.
