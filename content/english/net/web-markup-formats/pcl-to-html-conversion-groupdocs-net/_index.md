## Implementation Guide

### Overview of PCL to HTML Conversion Feature
This feature enables you to transform PCL documents into HTML format for easy viewing and editing in web browsers. 

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Ensure your project references GroupDocs.Conversion by following the installation instructions above.

#### Step 2: Load the PCL Document
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string inputFilePath = "path/to/your/file.pcl";

// Use a Converter instance to load your PCL document
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion steps will follow here
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Up HTML Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new MarkupConvertOptions();

// Customize conversion parameters if necessary
options.FixedLayout = true; // Preserve the layout of the original document
```

#### Step 4: Execute the Conversion Process

string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.html");

converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
```
- **Parameters Explained:** `MarkupConvertOptions` allows you to specify HTML-specific settings like layout preservation.
- **Return Values:** The conversion process writes an HTML file at the specified output path.

**Troubleshooting Tip:**
If your PCL file isn’t converting as expected, ensure it’s accessible and not corrupted. Check for any exceptions thrown during the loading phase.
