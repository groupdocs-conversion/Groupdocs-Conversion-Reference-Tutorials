## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load Source DOTM File

#### Overview
The first step is to load your DOTM file using the `Converter` class from GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 1.1: Specify the Path**
Ensure you have the correct path for your source DOTM file:
```csharp
string dotmFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.dotm";
```

**Step 1.2: Load the File**
Use the `Converter` class to load your document:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(dotmFilePath))
{
    // Ready for conversion.
}
```
This step initializes a `Converter` object, which will be used in further processing.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** If you encounter an error here, ensure the file path is correct and accessible.

### Feature 2: Convert DOTM to HTML

#### Overview
Now that your DOTM file is loaded, convert it into HTML format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Implementation Steps
**Step 2.1: Define Output Path**
Set up the output directory and filename for the converted HTML file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dotm-converted-to.html");
```

**Step 2.2: Set Conversion Options**
Create conversion options specific to HTML format:
```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```
This code snippet specifies that the output should be in web-friendly HTML format.

**Step 2.3: Perform the Conversion**
Finally, convert and save your DOTM file as an HTML document:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
The `Convert` method handles the conversion process based on specified options.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure the output directory exists before saving; otherwise, create it programmatically.

## Practical Applications
Converting DOTM files to HTML enables numerous possibilities:
1. **Web Publishing**: Easily publish Word templates as web pages.
2. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Integrate with CMS platforms that require HTML input for content creation.
