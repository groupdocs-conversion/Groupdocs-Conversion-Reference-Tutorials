**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
- Step-by-step instructions on converting MHT files to HTML.
- Best practices for optimizing performance with GroupDocs.Conversion.
- Practical applications of the conversion process in real-world scenarios.

Before diving into the code, ensure you have everything ready.

## Prerequisites

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
To follow this tutorial, you'll need:
- .NET Framework 4.6.1 or higher (or .NET Core)
- GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library version 25.3.0

### Environment Setup Requirements
Ensure your development environment is configured with Visual Studio (2017 or later) and access to the NuGet Package Manager.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with .NET project setup will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Conversion, install it via NuGet. Hereâ€™s how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps
Obtain a free trial license or purchase a temporary license to explore the full capabilities of GroupDocs.Conversion without limitations.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Initialize your environment for conversion:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize a license if you have one
        // License lic = new License();
        // lic.SetLicense("GroupDocs.Conversion.lic");

        Console.WriteLine("Setup completed.");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll walk through the conversion process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Load Your MHT File

Create an instance of the `Converter` class using your source MHT file path:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mht");
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Proceed with conversion steps.
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Set up the conversion options tailored for HTML format using `WebConvertOptions`:

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
// Configure additional settings if necessary.
```

### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Convert and save your MHT file to the desired HTML output path:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mht-converted-to.html");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified.
- Check for library version compatibility issues.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases where converting MHT to HTML is beneficial:
1. **Web Archiving**: Preserve web pages in a more accessible format for historical records.
2. **Email Integration**: Convert email archives into interactive HTML files.
3. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Seamlessly integrate archived content into CMS platforms.

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance, consider the following:
- Manage memory usage by disposing of objects promptly after use.
- Adjust conversion settings to balance quality and processing speed.
- Use asynchronous programming techniques for non-blocking operations.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to convert MHT files to HTML using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This skill can be particularly useful when dealing with web archives or email integration projects.

As next steps, explore more advanced features of the library and consider integrating this functionality into larger applications.
