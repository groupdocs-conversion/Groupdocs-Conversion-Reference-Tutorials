// Initialize the conversion handler.
var converter = new Converter("sample.htm");
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s break down the process of converting an HTM file into a TXT format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

### Convert HTML to Text

This feature allows you to transform your HTML files into plain text. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
First, specify the input and output paths for your files.

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.htm");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "htm-converted-to.txt");
```

#### Step 2: Load the HTML File
Create an instance of `Converter` to load your source file.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Configure conversion options for TXT format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Use the `Convert` method to transform and save your HTML file as text.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure that the input HTM file path is correct.
- Verify directory permissions for both reading the source and writing the output files.
- Update GroupDocs.Conversion if you encounter compatibility issues with other libraries.
