## Implementation Guide

With everything set up, let's implement HTML to CSV conversion.

### Loading and Converting the File

1. **Set Up Document Paths**
   Define directories for your source files and converted output:
   ```csharp
   const string DocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   ```

2. **Load the Source HTM File**
   Use the `Converter` class to load your HTML file:
   ```csharp
   string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(DocumentDirectory, "sample.htm");

   using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
   {
       // Conversion code will go here.
   }
   ```

3. **Define Conversion Options**
   Set the conversion options for CSV format:
   ```csharp
   SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Csv };
   ```

4. **Perform the Conversion**
   Execute the conversion and save the output:
   ```csharp
   string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "converted.csv");
   converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure `sample.htm` exists in your document directory.
- Verify file permissions for input and output directories to prevent access issues.
