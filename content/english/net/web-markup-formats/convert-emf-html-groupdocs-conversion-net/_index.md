## Implementation Guide
### Convert EMF to HTML
This feature lets you convert EMF files into HTML, making them viewable in web browsers.
#### Step 1: Define Paths
Define paths for your input document and output directory:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.emf");
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "emf-converted-to.html");
```
#### Step 2: Load the EMF File
Use GroupDocs.Conversion API to load your source file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion process will be handled in the next step.
}
```
#### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Determine the target format by specifying HTML conversion options:
```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
