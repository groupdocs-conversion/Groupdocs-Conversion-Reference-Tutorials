string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mhtml-converted-to.tex");
```

### Set Conversion Options
Define conversion options for transforming MHTML into TEX format. Specify the format type and any additional configurations:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex };
