Now that everything is set up, let's delve into the conversion process.

### Convert ODG to PPTX
This feature focuses on transforming an ODG file into a PowerPoint presentation. Hereâ€™s how you can implement it:

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter Object
Firstly, create and initialize a `Converter` object with your input ODG file path:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("your-input-file.odg"))
{
    // Continue to conversion steps...
}
```
*Why this step?* The `Converter` class is crucial for loading the file you wish to convert.

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Configure the output format by creating a `PresentationConvertOptions` object:

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
options.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Pptx;
```
*Why configure options?* Setting conversion options allows you to specify parameters like file format and additional settings.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Finally, execute the conversion by calling the `Convert` method:

```csharp
counter.Convert("output-file.pptx\
