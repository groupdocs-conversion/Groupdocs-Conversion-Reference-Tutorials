This sets up your environment to begin converting documents.
## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the conversion process into clear steps.
### Step 1: Initialize the Converter
Begin by initializing the `Converter` class with the path of your XLTX file. This step is crucial as it prepares your document for conversion:

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```
### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output
Finally, perform the conversion and save the result as a PPTX file. The `Convert` method handles this seamlessly:
```csharp
converter.Convert("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/xltx-converted-to.pptx", options);
```
#### Explanation of Parameters:
- **inputFilePath:** Path to your source XLTX file.
- **outputFile:** Destination path for the converted PPTX file.
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified and accessible.
