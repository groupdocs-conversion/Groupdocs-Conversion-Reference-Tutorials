```

Here's how to convert TIFF to PPT:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.tiff";
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "tiff-converted-to.ppt");

// Initialize the converter with your TIFF file
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion options for PPT format
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions
    {
        Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt
    };

    // Perform conversion and save the output
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

With GroupDocs.Conversion set up, let's implement the TIFF to PPT conversion feature.

### Convert TIFF to PowerPoint Presentation
Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Define Directory Paths
Specify your source documents and output file locations:
```csharp
const string DocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source TIFF File
Load the TIFF file for conversion:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(DocumentDirectory, "sample.tiff");
```

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options for PowerPoint
Initialize options and set the target format as PPT:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions
{
    Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt // Output to PowerPoint format
};
```

#### Step 4: Convert and Save the File
Use the `Converter` class for conversion, passing your specified options:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    string outputFile = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "tiff-converted-to.ppt");
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Check File Paths**: Ensure all paths are correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- **Verify Permissions**: Confirm your application can read and write to specified directories.
- **Update GroupDocs.Conversion**: Use the latest version of the library if issues arise.

3. **Marketing Campaigns**: Integrate product images directly into slide decks.

Integration with frameworks like ASP.NET can automate this process, enabling batch conversions through web applications or services.

## Performance Considerations
For optimal performance:
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects promptly using the `using` statement.
