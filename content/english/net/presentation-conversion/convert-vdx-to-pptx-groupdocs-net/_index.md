## Implementation Guide

In this section, we'll explore the main features of converting VDX to PPTX and setting up output directories.

### Convert VDX to PPTX

**Overview:** This feature focuses on transforming a VDX file into a PowerPoint presentation format (PPTX).

#### Step 1: Load the Source VDX File

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string sourceFilePath = "path/to/your/file.vdx";
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options for PPTX Format

Define the conversion settings:

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion and Save the Output

Execute the conversion process and save it as a PPTX file:

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vdx-converted-to.pptx");

using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
