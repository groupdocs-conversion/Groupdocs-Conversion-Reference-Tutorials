## Implementation Guide

### Convert Animated GIF to PPTX Feature

This feature enables the conversion of a GIF file into a PowerPoint presentation format. Let's break down the steps involved.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths and Setup Converter

First, define your input and output directories:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Define the output directory path
string inputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.gif"); // Path to input GIF file
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "gif-converted-to.pptx"); // Define the output PPTX file name

// Load the source GIF file
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions(); // Set conversion options for PowerPoint format
}
```

#### Step 2: Perform Conversion and Save Output

Within the using block, perform the conversion:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Convert and save the PPTX file
Console.WriteLine("Conversion Successful!");
```

### Setup Constants Class

To manage paths efficiently, create a utility class to hold your directory constants.

```csharp
using System.IO;

public static class Constants
{
    public static string GetOutputDirectoryPath()
    {
        return "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Return the path for the output directory
    }

    public static string SAMPLE_GIF = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.gif"); // Define path to sample GIF file
}
```

## Practical Applications

Converting animated GIFs to PPTX can enhance various workflows:

1. **Marketing Presentations**: Convert promotional GIFs into slideshows for client presentations.
2. **Educational Content**: Transform teaching materials from GIFs to interactive PowerPoint lectures.
