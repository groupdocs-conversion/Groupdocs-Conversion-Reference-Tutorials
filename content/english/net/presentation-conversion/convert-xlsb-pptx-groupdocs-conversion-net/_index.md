        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize a new Converter object with the source file path
            using (var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/source/file.xlsb"))
            {
                var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
                
                // Convert and save the output to PPTX format
                converter.Convert("output/path/converted-file.pptx", options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's delve into converting an XLSB file to a PPTX presentation using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Convert XLSB to PPTX

#### Overview
This feature allows you to automate the conversion of Excel binary files (XLSB) into PowerPoint presentations (PPTX), saving time and reducing manual errors.

##### Step 1: Define Paths
Start by setting up your output folder and file paths where the converted presentation will be saved. Replace placeholders with actual directory paths in your environment.

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlsb-converted-to.pptx");
```

##### Step 2: Load Source File
Load your source XLSB file using the Converter class. Ensure you specify the correct directory where the source file resides.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "SAMPLE_XLSB")))
{
    // Proceed with conversion steps
}
```

##### Step 3: Initialize Conversion Options
Initialize `PresentationConvertOptions` to specify that you are converting to a PowerPoint format.

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

##### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the PPTX file at your defined path.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary packages are installed via NuGet.
- **Path Errors**: Double-check directory paths for typos or incorrect permissions.
- **Version Compatibility**: Use compatible versions of .NET and GroupDocs.Conversion.
