## Implementation Guide

### Load a Markdown File for Conversion

This feature enables you to load your source Markdown file and prepares it for conversion.

#### Loading the Source MD File
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string markdownFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.md"; // Replace with your actual document path

// Initialize the Converter with the Markdown file.
using (var converter = new Converter(markdownFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for further processing.
}
```

### Configure Conversion Options

Set up conversion options to specify the target format as PowerPoint (.ppt).

#### Setting Up PresentationConvertOptions
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Create and configure presentation conversion options.
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions
{
    Format = FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt // Specify the target file type.
};
```

### Perform Conversion and Save Output

Execute the conversion process to transform your Markdown into a PowerPoint presentation.

#### Converting and Saving the PPT File
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your desired path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "md-converted-to.ppt");

// Re-load the Markdown file for demonstration.
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.md"))
{
    PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt };
    
    // Convert and save the output file.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
