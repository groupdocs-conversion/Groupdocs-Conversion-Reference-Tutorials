## Implementation Guide

Now, let's dive into converting DOCX files to PPT.

### Overview of DOCX to PPT Conversion
This feature streamlines the conversion process by transforming Word documents into PowerPoint presentations, enabling easy sharing and presentation of information.

#### Step 1: Load the Source Document
Load your DOCX file using the `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/document.docx")) {
    // Conversion code goes here
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Define conversion options for PowerPoint presentations with `PresentationConvertOptions`:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
// Configure additional settings if needed, e.g., slide size
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion by calling the `Convert` method:
```csharp
converter.Convert("output/path/presentation.ppt", options);
```
**Parameters and Method Purposes:**
- **input path**: The source DOCX file.
- **options**: Specifies how the conversion should be handled (e.g., format, quality).
- **output path**: Where to save the converted PPT file.

#### Step 4: Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure all paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that your document is not corrupted.
- Check for any licensing errors if applicable.

## Practical Applications

Here are some scenarios where DOCX to PPT conversion can be invaluable:
