##### Setting Conversion Options
Define the conversion options for PPT format. This involves specifying the output format as PPT using `PresentationConvertOptions`:
```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions
{
    Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt // Specify output format as PPT
};
```
##### Performing the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the resulting file to your desired path:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.ppt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
