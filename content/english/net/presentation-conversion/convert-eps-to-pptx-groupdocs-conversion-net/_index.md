#### Initialize Converter Object

Load your EPS file by initializing a `Converter` object:

```csharp
using var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
```

**Step 2:** Set Conversion Options

Specify the conversion options for PowerPoint format using `PresentationConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

**Step 3:** Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the result to your specified output path:
