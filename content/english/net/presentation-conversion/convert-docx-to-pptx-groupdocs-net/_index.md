```

## Implementation Guide

Now that you have everything set up, let's walk through the conversion process step by step.

### Document Conversion Setup

This section involves setting up paths for your input and output files. We’ll configure necessary directories to store converted documents.

#### Step 1: Define Directories
Create variables for your document directory and output directory to be used throughout the conversion process.

```csharp
string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string outputFolder = Path.Combine(YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY);
if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
}
```

#### Step 2: Specify Output File Path
Define the path for your converted file to ensure we know where to save our PPTX file.

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pptx");
```

### Document Conversion Process

With directories set up, you’re ready to convert your document into a PowerPoint presentation using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter Object
Create an instance of the `Converter` class, specifying the path to your input DOCX file.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY, "sample.docx")))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure Presentation Convert Options
Set up the conversion options tailored for PowerPoint presentations.

```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Call the `Convert` method, passing in your output file path and conversion options.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing DLLs**: Ensure all necessary GroupDocs libraries are referenced correctly.
