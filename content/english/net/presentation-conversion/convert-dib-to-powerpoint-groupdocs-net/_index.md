## Implementation Guide

### Feature Overview: Convert DIB to PowerPoint Presentation

The main feature of this tutorial is converting a DIB file into a PowerPoint presentation. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Set Up Paths and Directories
Ensure that you specify paths for your input DIB file and output directory.

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.dib");
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dib-converted-to.ppt");

// Ensure the output directory exists
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
```

#### Step 2: Load and Configure Conversion Options
Use `GroupDocs.Conversion` to load your DIB file and configure options for PowerPoint conversion.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Configure conversion options for PowerPoint format
    PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt };

    // Perform the conversion from DIB to PPT
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

This snippet loads your DIB file and sets up conversion parameters. The `PresentationConvertOptions` class allows you to specify the target format.
