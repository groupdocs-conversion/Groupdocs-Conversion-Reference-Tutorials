## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of converting an MPX file to a PowerPoint presentation.

### Load and Convert MPX File to PPT

**Overview:** This feature allows you to load your MPX files and convert them into PowerPoint presentations using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Define Paths
Start by specifying the directories for your input and output files:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mpx");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mpx-converted-to.ppt");
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Set up the conversion options for PowerPoint presentations:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define presentation conversion options.
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt
};
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
// Convert MPX to PPT format using defined options.
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue:** Ensure your paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
