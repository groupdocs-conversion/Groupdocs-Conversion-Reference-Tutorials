## Implementation Guide
### Convert XLSB to PowerPoint
This feature allows you to convert an XLSB file into a PPT format. Let's break down the implementation steps:

#### Load the Source File
1. **Initialize Converter:** Create an instance of `Converter` class, specifying the path to your XLSB file.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentDirectory + "/sample.xlsb"))
```

This step prepares your source file for conversion by loading it into memory.

#### Set Conversion Options
2. **Configure PresentationOptions:** Define `PresentationConvertOptions` to specify the target format as PowerPoint PPT.

```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt };
```

This configuration determines how the data will be formatted in the output file.

#### Perform Conversion
3. **Execute Conversion:** Call the `Convert` method to transform your XLSB into a PPT and save it to your desired location.

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlsb-converted-to.ppt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

This step executes the conversion process and outputs the file to the specified directory.
