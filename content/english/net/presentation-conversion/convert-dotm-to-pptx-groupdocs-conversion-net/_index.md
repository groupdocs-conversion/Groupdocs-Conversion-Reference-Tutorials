## Implementation Guide

### Convert DOTM to PPTX Feature Overview

This section demonstrates converting a .dotm file to a .pptx format. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET simplifies this process, providing high-quality conversion with minimal code.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories

Start by defining the input and output directories:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
```

#### Step 2: Load Source DOTM File

Load your .dotm file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class. This step initializes the conversion process.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.dotm")))
{
    // Conversion options will be defined here
}
```

#### Step 3: Initialize Conversion Options

Set up the conversion options to specify the output format as PPTX:

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Define Output Path and Convert

Determine where the converted file should be saved, then perform the conversion:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "dotm-converted-to.pptx");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue**: File not found errors. Ensure your paths are correct and accessible.
- **Performance**: For large files, consider optimizing memory usage or breaking the conversion into smaller tasks.
