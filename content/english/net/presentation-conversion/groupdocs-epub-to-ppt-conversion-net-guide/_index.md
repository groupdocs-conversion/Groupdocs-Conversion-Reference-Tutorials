**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**

```

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Once the necessary dependencies are installed, let's initialize and set up the GroupDocs.Conversion library in your .NET project.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Here's how to start using C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

namespace EpubToPptConversion
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Define the path for your EPUB file and output directory.
            string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.epub";
            string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");

            // Initialize the Converter object with the input file.
            using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
            {
                // Set up conversion options for PowerPoint presentation format.
                var convertOptions = new PresentationConvertOptions();

                // Convert and save the EPUB as a PPT file.
                string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.pptx");
                converter.Convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
            }

            Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this setup:
- We define paths for input (EPUB) and output files (PPT).
- Initialize a `Converter` object with the EPUB file.
- Set up conversion options for PowerPoint format using `PresentationConvertOptions`.
- Convert and save the file in PPTX format.

## Implementation Guide

### Converting an EPUB to PPT

#### Overview
This feature allows you to convert digital book files into PowerPoint presentations, making it easy to incorporate rich content into slideshows or meetings. Let's break down the steps:

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Initialize Converter
As shown in the setup code above, specify the input EPUB file path and the output directory for saving the converted PPT.

```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.epub";
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Create an instance of `PresentationConvertOptions` to define how the EPUB file should be converted into a presentation format.

```csharp
var convertOptions = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Execute Conversion
Utilize the `Converter` object’s `Convert` method to perform the conversion and save the output as PPTX.

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.pptx");
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all file paths are correct and accessible.
- Handle exceptions using try-catch blocks to manage any conversion errors.
- Check for the latest version of GroupDocs.Conversion if issues persist.
