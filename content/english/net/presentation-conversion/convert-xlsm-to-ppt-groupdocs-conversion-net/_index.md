using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsm";
        
        // Initialize the converter with the path to your XLSM file
        using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading a Source File

**Overview:** Begin by loading an XLSM file for conversion. This step is crucial as it prepares the file for transformation into a PPT format.

#### Step 1: Initialize Converter
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsm";

// Load the source XLSM file using the Converter class
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("XLSM file loaded successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```
- **Parameters Explained:** `documentPath` is a string variable holding the path to your XLSM file. The `Converter` object handles loading and conversion operations.

### Setting Conversion Options

**Overview:** Configure settings for converting an XLSM file into PowerPoint format by specifying target options.

#### Step 2: Define Presentation Convert Options
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Create an instance of PresentationConvertOptions specifying the PPT format
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions 
        { 
            Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt 
        };
    }
}
```
- **Key Configuration:** The `Format` property within `PresentationConvertOptions` is set to `Ppt`, indicating the conversion target.

### Performing Conversion and Saving Output

**Overview:** Execute the conversion process, transforming your XLSM file into a PPT presentation, and save it to a designated directory.

#### Step 3: Convert and Save
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
        string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlsm-converted-to.ppt");
        
        // Load the XLSM file for conversion
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsm"))
        {
            // Apply conversion options and save the resulting PPT file
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
            
            Console.WriteLine($"Conversion completed. File saved at {outputFile}");
        }
    }
}
```
- **Troubleshooting Tips:** Ensure paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`. Verify write permissions for the output directory.
