## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into logical sections based on the features we want to implement.

### Load a DJVU File Using GroupDocs.Conversion

**Overview**
Loading a DJVU file is the first step in preparing it for conversion. This feature utilizes GroupDocs.Conversion to open and prepare your document.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Initialize the Converter**
   
   Use the `Converter` class to load your DJVU file:
   
   ```csharp
   using System;
   using GroupDocs.Conversion;

   string djvuFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.djvu"; // Replace with your DJVU file path

   using (var converter = new Converter(djvuFilePath))
   {
       // The converter is now ready for further operations.
   }
   ```

2. **Understand the Parameters**
   
   - `djvuFilePath`: Path to your DJVU file. Ensure it's correctly specified.

3. **Method Purpose**
   
   - The constructor of `Converter` initializes and loads the document, making it ready for conversion or other processing tasks.

### Convert DJVU to PowerPoint

**Overview**
This feature demonstrates converting a loaded DJVU file into a PowerPoint presentation format (.ppt).

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Set Up Output Directory**
   
   Define where you want your converted files saved:
   
   ```csharp
   using System.IO;
   using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

   string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Set the directory for saving output files
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "djvu-converted-to.ppt");
   ```

2. **Configure Conversion Options**
   
   Specify that you want to convert your file into PowerPoint format:
   
   ```csharp
   PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt };
   ```

3. **Perform the Conversion**
   
   Use the `Convert` method to transform and save your DJVU file as a PowerPoint presentation:
   
   ```csharp
   using (var converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.djvu")) // Load DJVU file again for standalone execution
   {
       converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
   }
   ```
