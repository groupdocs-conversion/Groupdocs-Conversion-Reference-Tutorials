## Implementation Guide

### Load Source File

#### Overview

Loading your source MSG file is the first step in converting it to PPT. This section covers initializing the GroupDocs.Conversion library and loading your MSG file.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize the Converter**
   - Create an instance of `Converter` by passing the path of your MSG file.

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentDirectory + "/sample.msg");
```
2. **Verify File Path**
   - Ensure that `sample.msg` exists in your specified directory to avoid runtime errors.

### Set Conversion Options

#### Overview

This section will guide you through configuring the conversion settings necessary for transforming an MSG file into a PPT format.

**Steps:**
1. **Configure Presentation Convert Options**
   - Create an instance of `PresentationConvertOptions`.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
options.Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt; // Specify target format as PowerPoint (PPT)
```
2. **Understand Conversion Parameters**
   - The `Format` property specifies the output file type.

### Save Converted File

#### Overview

After setting up your conversion parameters, you need to save the converted PPT file in a specified directory.

**Steps:**
1. **Define Output Path**
   - Set an output directory and combine it with the desired filename for the converted file.

```csharp
using System.IO;

string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "msg-converted-to.ppt");
```
2. **Perform Conversion and Save**
   - Use the `Convert` method to execute the conversion process and save the PPT file.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all paths are correctly set and directories exist.
- Check for any exceptions thrown during the conversion process to diagnose issues effectively.
