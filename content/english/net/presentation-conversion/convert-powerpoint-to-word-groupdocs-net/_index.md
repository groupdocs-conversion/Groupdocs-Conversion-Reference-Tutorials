{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}

string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ppt");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ppt-converted-to.docx");

// Initialize the Converter class
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Specify conversion options for Word processing format
    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    
    // Convert and save the output DOCX file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Loading and Converting PPT to DOCX

This feature enables you to load a PowerPoint file and convert it into a Word document format.

#### Overview
Converting PPT files to DOCX allows for better content manipulation and integration with other office tools. Here's how to implement this:

**1. Setting Up File Paths**
Set your source and output paths appropriately. The code snippet above demonstrates how to specify these paths using `Path.Combine`.
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}

string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ppt");
```

**2. Initializing the Converter**
Initialize the `Converter` class with your PPT file path.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be placed here.
}
```

**3. Setting Conversion Options**
Specify conversion options to dictate how the output DOCX should look like.
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

**4. Performing the Conversion**
Execute the conversion process and save the result in your specified path.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Feature: Setting Up Directory Paths

Ensuring correct directory paths is crucial for file handling operations.

#### Overview
Set up directories where source files are located and outputs will be saved. Create these directories if they don't exist to avoid runtime errors.

**1. Define Directories**
Define your document storage paths early in the code to ensure consistency.
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Check and Create Output Directory**
Use `Directory.Exists` and `Directory.CreateDirectory` to handle directory creation dynamically:
```csharp
if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```

## Practical Applications

- **Documentation:** Convert presentations into editable Word documents for better documentation.
- **Collaboration:** Share content with team members who prefer using Word over PowerPoint.
- **Content Management:** Integrate PPT to DOCX conversion in CMS systems for enhanced content workflows.

Integrating GroupDocs.Conversion can streamline these processes and more within your .NET applications, providing flexibility across different platforms and frameworks.

## Performance Considerations

When dealing with file conversions, performance is key. Here are some tips:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Close unused files and streams promptly.
- **Memory Management:** Use `using` statements to ensure resources are disposed of correctly.
- **Batch Processing:** If converting multiple files, consider batch processing to reduce overhead.

## Conclusion
