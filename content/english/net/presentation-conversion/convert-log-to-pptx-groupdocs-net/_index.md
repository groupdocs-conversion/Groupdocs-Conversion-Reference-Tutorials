## Implementation Guide

### Convert LOG File to PPTX Format

#### Overview
This section covers converting a log file into a PowerPoint presentation, making data more accessible and visually engaging.

#### Step-by-Step Process
**Load the Source Log File**

Load your source LOG file using GroupDocs.Conversion:
