// Initialize the converter with a source PST file.
string sourceFilePath = "path/to/your/sample.pst";
var loadOptions = new LoadOptions();

if (Path.GetExtension(sourceFilePath).Equals(".ost", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
    loadOptions = new PersonalStorageLoadOptions();
}

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath, loadOptions)) {
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading PST Files
#### Overview
Loading a PST file is the initial step in the conversion process. This section guides you through preparing your files for conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Identify File Type**
   - Determine if the source file is an OST or PST and set load options accordingly.

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pst");
var converterOptions = new LoadOptions();

if (Path.GetExtension(sourceFilePath).Equals(".ost", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)) {
    // Use specific configurations for OST files.
    converterOptions = new PersonalStorageLoadOptions();
}
```

**2. Initialize Converter**
   - Create a `Converter` instance using the source file path and load options.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath, converterOptions)) {
    // Ready to perform conversion.
}
```

### Converting PST to PPTX
#### Overview
After loading, convert your PST files into the presentable PPTX format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Set Conversion Options**
   - Define the output directory and file naming pattern.

```csharp
string outputDirectory = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFilePattern = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "pst-converted-{0}-to.pptx");
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
int counter = 1;
```

**2. Perform Conversion**
   - Use the `Converter` instance to convert and save the file.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath)) {
    converter.Convert(
        savePath => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFilePattern, counter++), FileMode.Create),
        options
    );
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Not Found**: Ensure the source file path is correct.
- **Permission Issues**: Verify that your application has read/write permissions for involved directories.
