## Implementation Guide

This section walks you through converting an XLAM file into a PPTX format, focusing on each step of the process.

### Load and Convert the Document

#### Overview
Converting documents involves loading your source file and specifying conversion options to transform it into the desired format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define File Paths**
Start by setting up paths for both input and output files:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";

// Input XLAM file
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xlam");
// Output PPTX file
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlam-converted-to.pptx");
```

**2. Initialize the Converter**
Load your XLAM using the `Converter` class and specify options for PowerPoint conversion.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions(); // Configure conversion options for PPTX
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Execute conversion and save output
}
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `inputFile`: Path to your XLAM file.
- `outputFile`: Destination path for the converted PPTX file.
- `PresentationConvertOptions()`: Sets default options for PowerPoint conversion.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found:** Ensure the paths and filenames are correct. Check directory permissions if needed.
- **Conversion Errors:** Verify that you're using a compatible version of GroupDocs.Conversion.
