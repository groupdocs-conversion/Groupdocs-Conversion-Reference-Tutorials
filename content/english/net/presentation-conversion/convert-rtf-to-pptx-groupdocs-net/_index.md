## Implementation Guide

### Convert RTF to PPTX

#### Overview
This feature allows you to convert an RTF document into a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX) using GroupDocs.Conversion, making it ideal for creating visually appealing presentations from text documents.

#### Implementation Steps

##### Step 1: Define File Paths and Names
Specify the paths and names of your input RTF file and output PPTX file:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.rtf");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "rtf-converted-to.pptx");
```

##### Step 2: Load the RTF File
Use the `Converter` class to load your RTF file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion process will be initiated here
}
```
This ensures that your document is ready for conversion.

##### Step 3: Initialize Presentation Convert Options
Configure the conversion options using `PresentationConvertOptions`:

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```
These options allow you to customize how the RTF content appears in the PPTX format.

##### Step 4: Execute Conversion
Finally, convert and save your document:

```csharp
csv converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This step performs the actual conversion, storing the result in your specified output location.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** Ensure paths are correctly defined to avoid file-not-found errors.
- **Solution:** Double-check directory names and verify file permissions.
