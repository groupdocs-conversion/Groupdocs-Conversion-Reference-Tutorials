## Implementation Guide

Now let's break down each feature and implementation step by step.

### Load a Source File

**Overview:**
Loading your source HTML file is the first step in conversion. This allows GroupDocs.Conversion to access and process the content within.

#### Step 1: Define the Path
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.htm";
```
- **Purpose:** Specify where your HTM file is located on your system.
  
#### Step 2: Create a Converter Instance
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for operations.
}
```
- **Explanation:** This initializes the conversion process. The `Converter` object reads and prepares your file for transformation.

### Configure Conversion Options

**Overview:**
Configuring conversion options allows you to specify how your HTML should be transformed into a PowerPoint presentation.

#### Step 1: Create PresentationConvertOptions
```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Format to PPT
```csharp
options.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt;
```
- **Explanation:** Specifies that the output should be a PowerPoint file in `.ppt` format.

### Perform File Conversion
