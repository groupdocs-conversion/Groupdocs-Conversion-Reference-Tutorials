    }
}
```
This code snippet sets up the `Converter` class with an input JPF file, preparing it for conversion.

## Implementation Guide

### Converting JPF to PPTX: A Feature Overview
GroupDocs.Conversion makes converting JPEG 2000 Image Files (.jpf) to PowerPoint Open XML Presentations (.pptx) straightforward. This feature maintains image quality and allows seamless integration into presentations.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation:

**1. Configure the Converter**
Initialize and configure your converter object with necessary parameters like input file path and desired output format.

```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/input.jpf";
string outputFilePath = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output.pptx";

// Initialize converter
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Set conversion options for PPTX
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
    
    // Convert and save the document
    converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
}
```

**2. Understanding Parameters and Configuration**
- `inputFilePath`: Path to your source JPF file.
- `outputFilePath`: Destination path for the converted PPTX file.
