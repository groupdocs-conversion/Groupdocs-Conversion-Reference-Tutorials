## Implementation Guide

### Converting EML to PPT

Now, let's focus on the core functionality: converting an EML file into a PowerPoint presentation.

#### Step 1: Load Your EML File

First, use GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class to load your source EML file. This initiates the conversion process:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion setup complete.
}
```

#### Step 2: Specify Conversion Options

Next, define the format you want to convert to using `PresentationConvertOptions`:

```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt };
```

This specifies that your EML file will be converted into a PPT file.

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion and Save

Finally, execute the conversion and save the output to the desired location:

```csharp
string outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/eml-converted-to.ppt";
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Parameters & Configuration

- **Input File:** Path to your source EML file.
- **Output File:** Destination path for the PPT file.
- **Options:** Customize conversion settings like format type using `PresentationConvertOptions`.
