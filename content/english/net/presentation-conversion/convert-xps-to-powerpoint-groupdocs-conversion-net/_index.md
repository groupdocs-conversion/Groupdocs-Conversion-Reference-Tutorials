### Step 1: Set Up Paths and Convert Options
Define paths for your input XPS file and output PPT file:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with actual path

// Define source and target file paths
string sourceXpsFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xps");
string convertedPptFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xps-converted-to.ppt");

using (var converter = new Converter(sourceXpsFilePath))
{
    PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt };

    // Convert and save the output file
    converter.Convert(convertedPptFilePath, options);
}
```
#### Explanation:
