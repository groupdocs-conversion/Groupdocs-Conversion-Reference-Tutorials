```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Convert AI File to PowerPoint Format

This feature demonstrates converting an Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file into a PowerPoint Presentation (.ppt).

#### Step 1: Define Directories

Start by setting up your input and output directories:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source AI File

Load the AI file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ai")))
{
    // Conversion process will be defined here.
}
```

**Why?** Loading the file is crucial for preparing it for conversion.

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

Set up the options to specify the output format as PPT:

```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt };
```

**Explanation:** This configuration tells GroupDocs.Conversion what type of file we want our AI document converted into.

#### Step 4: Perform Conversion and Save

Execute the conversion and save the output PPT file:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ai-converted-to.ppt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Why?** This step finalizes the process by generating the PowerPoint file.

### Troubleshooting Tips
