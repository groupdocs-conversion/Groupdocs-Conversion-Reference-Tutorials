## Implementation Guide

Now, let's explore how to convert a PNG image to PPT format step-by-step.

### Feature: Convert PNG to PPT

**Overview**: This feature enables converting PNG files into PowerPoint presentations, preserving your visuals in a dynamic format.

#### Step 1: Define Input and Output Paths

Specify paths for your input PNG file and the desired output directory:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.png"); // Replace with actual path
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", ".\" );
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "png-converted-to.ppt");
```

**Explanation**: The `inputFilePath` should point to the PNG file for conversion. Adjust paths as necessary.

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the PNG File

Load the source PNG using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class, then configure options for PowerPoint format:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions 
    {
        Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt // Target PPT format
    };
    
    // Perform the conversion and save the output file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Converter` class loads your PNG. Setting the `Format` to `PresentationFileType.Ppt` specifies a PowerPoint presentation as the target format.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found Errors**: Double-check input paths.
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure proper read/write permissions for directories.
- **Conversion Failures**: Verify compatibility with supported formats and ensure correct installation of GroupDocs.Conversion.
