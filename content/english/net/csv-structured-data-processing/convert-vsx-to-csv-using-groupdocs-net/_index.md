    public void ConvertVSXtoCSV(string inputFile, string outputPath)
    {
        var converter = new Converter(inputFile);
        
        // Define CSV conversion options
        var options = new CsvConvertOptions();

        // Perform the conversion and save output file
        converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
    }
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Overview of Feature: Convert VSX to CSV
This feature enables you to convert a .vsx file into a more universally accessible .csv format. Let's break down the process.

#### Step 1: Load Your VSX File

class ConverterHandler
{
    public void ConvertVSXtoCSV(string inputFile, string outputPath)
    {
        var converter = new Converter(inputFile);
        
        // Define CSV conversion options
        var options = new CsvConvertOptions();

        // Perform the conversion and save output file
        converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
    }
}
```
#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Here, specify that the output should be in CSV format:
```csharp
// Define CSV conversion options
var options = new CsvConvertOptions();
```
