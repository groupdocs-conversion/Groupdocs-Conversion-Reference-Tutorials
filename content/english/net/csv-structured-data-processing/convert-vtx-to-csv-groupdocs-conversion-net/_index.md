using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize the Converter object with input VTX file path
        using (Converter converter = new Converter("your-input-file.vtx"))
        {
            var options = new CsvConvertOptions();
            
            // Convert and save the output CSV file
            converter.Convert("output-file.csv", options);
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we will walk through each step needed to convert a VTX file into a CSV format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Load Your VTX File

**Overview**

First, load your VTX file by creating an instance of the `Converter` class and passing the path of your VTX file.

**Implementation Steps**
1. **Initialize Converter Object:**
   - Create a new instance of the `Converter` object with the path to your VTX file.
   ```csharp
   using (Converter converter = new Converter("your-input-file.vtx"))
   {
       // Conversion logic will go here
   }
   ```
2. **Why This Step Matters:**
   Loading the file correctly is crucial as it sets up the necessary environment for conversion, ensuring GroupDocs.Conversion can access and interpret your VTX data.

### Convert to CSV

**Overview**

Once loaded, set our target format to CSV using `CsvConvertOptions` and perform the conversion.

**Implementation Steps**
1. **Set Conversion Options:**
   - Instantiate `CsvConvertOptions`.
   ```csharp
   var options = new CsvConvertOptions();
   ```
2. **Perform Conversion:**
   - Use the `Convert` method to transform the VTX file into a CSV format.
   ```csharp
   converter.Convert("output-file.csv", options);
   ```
3. **Why This Step Matters:**
   The conversion step is where GroupDocs.Conversion translates your data from one format to another, making it accessible for various applications that support CSV.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found Error:** Double-check the file path and ensure the VTX file exists in the specified directory.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify you have read/write permissions on the directories involved in the process.
