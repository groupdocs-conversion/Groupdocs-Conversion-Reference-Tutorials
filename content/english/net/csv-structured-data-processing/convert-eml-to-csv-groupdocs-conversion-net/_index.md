class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.eml";
        
        // Initialize Converter object with the EML file path
        using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's walk through each feature step-by-step to convert your EML files.

### Load EML File

**Overview:** This step involves loading the EML file you wish to convert using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Define the Source Path

Set the path to your source EML file:

```csharp
string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.eml";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter Object

Create a `Converter` object with the specified path. This will handle loading the file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // File is now ready for conversion operations.
}
```

### Convert to CSV Format

**Overview:** Here, you'll convert the loaded EML file into a CSV format.

#### Step 1: Set Output Path and Options

Define where the converted file will be saved and set the conversion options:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "eml-converted-to.csv");

// Specify conversion options for CSV format
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Csv };
```

#### Step 2: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion using the `Converter` object:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure your output directory path is correct and writable.

## Practical Applications

Converting EML files to CSV can be useful in several scenarios:
1. **Data Analysis:** Extract email metadata for analysis in spreadsheet software like Excel.
