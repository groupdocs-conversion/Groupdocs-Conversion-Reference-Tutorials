## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to convert a CSV file into TXT format.

### Feature: CSV to TXT Conversion

This feature allows seamless conversion of any CSV file into a plain text file using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your File Paths

Define the directories for your input CSV and output TXT files:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.csv");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "csv-converted-to.txt");

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!Directory.Exists(outputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
}
```

#### Step 2: Load and Convert Using GroupDocs.Conversion

Load your CSV file and set up conversion options for the TXT format:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Define conversion options for TXT format
    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Txt };
    
    // Convert the file and save it as a TXT document
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Explanation of Key Steps

- **Input & Output Paths:** Ensure your paths are correct to avoid errors.
- **Directory Creation:** The code checks if the output directory exists before creating it to prevent exceptions.
