```csharp
try
{
    converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error loading VSTM file: " + ex.Message);
}
```

### Convert VSTM to CSV

Now, convert your loaded VSTM file into a CSV format.

#### Step 2: Define Output Path and Conversion Options
Specify the output path for the converted file and set up conversion options:
```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\
