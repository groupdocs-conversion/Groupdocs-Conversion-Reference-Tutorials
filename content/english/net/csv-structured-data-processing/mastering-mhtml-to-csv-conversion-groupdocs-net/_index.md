namespace MhtmlToCsvConversion
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set up the license (if available)
            License license = new License();

            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion initialized successfully!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process into loading an MHTML file and converting it to CSV format.

### Load MHTML File

#### Overview

Loading an MHTML file is the first step before conversion. This feature prepares your data for transformation using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Define the Document Path**

Specify where your MHTML document resides:
```csharp
string sampleMhtmlPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mhtml");
```

**2. Load the MHTML File**

Using the `Converter` class, load your file into the application:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sampleMhtmlPath))
{
    // The loaded file is now ready for further processing.
}
```

### Convert MHTML to CSV

#### Overview

Converting an MHTML file to a CSV format involves setting specific conversion options and executing the transformation.

#### Steps to Implement

**1. Define Output Directory and File Path**

Determine where the converted CSV file should be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mhtml-converted-to.csv");
```

**2. Load Source MHTML File and Convert**

Prepare your MHTML document for conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mhtml")))
{
    // Set conversion options to CSV format
    SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Csv };

    // Perform the conversion and save the output file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

#### Explanation of Parameters

- `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`: Configures settings for converting files into spreadsheet formats.
- `Format`: Specifies the target format (CSV in this case).

### Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues might include incorrect file paths or missing dependencies. Ensure all directories exist and the correct GroupDocs.Conversion version is referenced.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Analysis**: Converting web archives to CSV for easier manipulation.
2. **Report Generation**: Preparing datasets from MHTML files for business reports.
3. **Integration with .NET Systems**: Use within larger workflows, such as automated reporting systems or data ingestion pipelines.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance during conversion:

- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory usage and manage resources efficiently in your applications.
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple files simultaneously to reduce overhead.

These practices ensure efficient and effective conversions.
