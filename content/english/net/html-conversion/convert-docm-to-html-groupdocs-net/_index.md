Here's how to initialize the library in your C# application:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize GroupDocs.Conversion
var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/sample.docm");
```

## Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to convert DOCM files into HTML format.

### Convert DOCM to HTML

#### Overview
This feature converts a Microsoft Word Macro-Enabled Document (DOCM) file into an HTML file, useful for web publishing or integrating documents into web applications.

#### Step 1: Load the Source DOCM File
Specify your document directory and output paths:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Your source files path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Where you want to save the HTML file
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter with Source File Path
Load the DOCM file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.docm")))
{
    // Proceed to conversion setup
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Converter` class handles the loading of your source document. Ensure you provide a valid path.

#### Step 3: Configure HTML Conversion Options
Set up the conversion options for HTML format:

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

**Key Configuration**: `WebConvertOptions` specifies that the output should be in web-friendly HTML format.

#### Step 4: Execute Conversion and Save Output
Perform the conversion and save the output:

```csharp
converter.Convert(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "docm-converted-to.html"), options);
```

**Explanation**: This line performs the conversion and saves the output in your specified directory using `WebConvertOptions` for HTML-specific settings.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly set to avoid file not found errors.
- Verify that necessary permissions are granted to read/write files in the directories.
