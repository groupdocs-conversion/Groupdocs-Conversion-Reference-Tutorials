```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the Converter object with the BMP file path
        using (var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/sample.bmp"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion is ready for action!");
        }
    }
}
```

This basic setup allows you to start converting files. Let's delve into the implementation process.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: BMP to HTML Conversion

This feature highlights how to convert a BMP file into an HTML format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Set Up Directories and File Paths
First, define paths for your input BMP and output HTML files:

```csharp
using System.IO;

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Define the path to the BMP file you want to convert
string bmpFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.bmp");

// Define the output HTML file path
string htmlOutputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "bmp-converted-to.html");
```

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the File
Load your BMP using GroupDocs.Conversion and set up conversion options:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(bmpFilePath))
{
    // Set conversion options for converting to Web format (HTML)
    var options = new WebConvertOptions();
    
    // Execute the conversion from BMP to HTML and save the output file
    converter.Convert(htmlOutputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Converter**: Handles loading and managing the source document.
- **WebConvertOptions**: Configures settings for web-compatible formats like HTML.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your input BMP path is correct to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify output directory permissions to prevent write errors.

## Practical Applications

Explore these real-world scenarios where BMP to HTML conversion can be beneficial:
1. **Digital Content Creation**: Convert image-based content into interactive web pages.
2. **Document Archiving**: Transform historical images into searchable, accessible formats.
3. **Web Development**: Integrate converted HTML files seamlessly into websites.

Integrating GroupDocs.Conversion with other .NET systems enhances automation and workflow efficiency.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory usage to prevent leaks.
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple BMPs in a batch for efficiency.
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Use async methods to improve responsiveness.

Follow best practices for .NET memory management, ensuring smooth operation and stability.
