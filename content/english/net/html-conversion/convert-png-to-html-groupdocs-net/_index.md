## Implementation Guide
Let's dive into converting PNG files to HTML using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET by exploring key features.
### Feature 1: Loading a Source PNG File
#### Overview
Loading your source PNG is the initial step, ensuring correct handling of the file path and format before processing.
```csharp
string pngFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.png"; // Placeholder path
groupdocs.Conversion.Converter converter;
try {
    // Load source PNG using GroupDocs.Conversion
    converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(pngFilePath);
} catch (Exception ex) {
    Console.WriteLine("Error loading PNG file: " + ex.Message);
}
```
#### Explanation
- **`pngFilePath`:** Holds the path to your PNG file. Replace with actual location.
- **Method Purpose:** Initializes a converter object ready for processing.
### Feature 2: Converting PNG to HTML Format
#### Overview
After loading, convert the image into an HTML format by specifying conversion options and executing the process.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Placeholder path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "png-converted-to.html");
WebConvertOptions options = new WebConvertOptions();
try {
    if (converter != null) {
        converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
    }
} catch (Exception ex) {
    Console.WriteLine("Error during conversion: " + ex.Message);
}
```
#### Explanation
- **Output Configuration:** Set output directory and file name for the HTML document.
