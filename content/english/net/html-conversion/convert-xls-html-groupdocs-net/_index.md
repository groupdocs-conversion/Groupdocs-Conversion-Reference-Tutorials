using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

namespace ConvertXlsToHtml
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.xls");
            string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ConvertedHtml");

            if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
            {
                Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
            }

            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xls-converted-to.html");

            using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath))
            {
                var options = new WebConvertOptions();
                converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the conversion process into clear steps.

### Feature: Loading and Converting XLS to HTML

#### Overview
This feature allows you to load an XLS file and convert it into an HTML document using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This is particularly useful when you need to display spreadsheet data on a web page.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Define File Paths**
- Set the path to your source XLS file and the output directory where the converted HTML will be saved.
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.xls");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ConvertedHtml");

if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
}
```

**Step 2: Initialize Converter**
- Create an instance of the `Converter` class with your source file path. This loads the XLS file into memory.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion process will be handled here.
}
```

**Step 3: Specify HTML Conversion Options**
- Use `WebConvertOptions` to set conversion parameters for the HTML format. This ensures the converted file meets web standards.
```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

**Step 4: Perform Conversion**
- Call the `Convert` method, passing in the output file path and conversion options. The result is an HTML document generated from your XLS file.
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xls-converted-to.html");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that the source file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify directory permissions for writing the converted files.
- Check if the correct version of GroupDocs.Conversion is referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where converting XLS to HTML can be beneficial:
1. **Web Portals**: Display Excel data dynamically on websites without needing server-side spreadsheet processing.
2. **Reports and Dashboards**: Integrate with web-based reporting tools for visualizing data analytics.
3. **Documentation**: Use converted documents as part of interactive documentation or user manuals online.
4. **Collaboration Tools**: Enhance document sharing platforms by allowing users to view spreadsheets in a browser-friendly format.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance during conversion:
- Limit the size and complexity of your XLS files to reduce processing time.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to prevent blocking your application's main thread.
- Manage memory efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets or multiple conversions at once.
