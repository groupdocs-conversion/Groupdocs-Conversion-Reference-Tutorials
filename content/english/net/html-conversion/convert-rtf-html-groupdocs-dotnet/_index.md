## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of converting an RTF document into HTML using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. We'll approach this in clear, manageable steps.

### Overview of RTF to HTML Conversion

Converting an RTF to HTML allows you to take advantage of web-based document viewing and editing capabilities. It’s a straightforward process with GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter

We begin by creating a `Converter` instance for our source RTF file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.rtf"))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

*Explanation:* The `Converter` class is initialized with the path to your RTF document, preparing it for conversion.

#### Step 2: Set Up Convert Options

Next, configure the HTML conversion options:

```csharp
var htmlOptions = new MarkupConvertOptions();
htmlOptions.FixedLayout = true; // Ensure layout consistency.
```

*Explanation:* `MarkupConvertOptions` allows customization of how your document will be converted. Here, we enable a fixed layout for better presentation.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Now, execute the conversion from RTF to HTML:

```csharp
converter.Convert("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/output.html\
