// Load and prepare for conversion
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceOtgFilePath))
{
    // Create conversion options for HTML format
    var htmlConversionOptions = new WebConvertOptions();

    converter.Convert(outputHtmlFilePath, htmlConversionOptions);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Load and Convert OTG File to HTML

This feature enables you to load an OpenDocument Graphic Template (OTG) file and convert it into HTML format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define Document Paths

Determine the input and output paths for your documents to ensure files are correctly loaded and saved:

```csharp
// Define document paths
currentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
externalDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\";

sourceOtgFilePath = Path.Combine(currentDirectory, "sample.otg");
outputHtmlFilePath = Path.Combine(externalDirectory, "otg-converted-to.html");
```

#### Step 2: Load the OTG File

Using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class, load your OTG file:

```csharp
// Initialize converter with the source OTG file path
groupDocsConverter = new Converter(sourceOtgFilePath);
{
    // Prepare to convert using HTML options
    htmlConversionOptions = new WebConvertOptions();
    
    // Convert and save as HTML
    groupDocsConverter.Convert(outputHtmlFilePath, htmlConversionOptions);
}
```

**Parameters & Method Purposes:**
- `Converter`: Loads the source file for conversion.
- `WebConvertOptions()`: Specifies that the output format should be HTML.
