## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process step-by-step.

### Converting ODT to HTML

#### Overview
Converting an ODT file into HTML format allows you to easily share and display documents on web platforms. This section guides you through configuring and executing this conversion.

#### Step 1: Load the Source ODT File
Start by loading your source ODT file using GroupDocs.Conversionâ€™s `Converter` class.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.odt"))
{
    // Conversion steps will follow here
}
```

*Why This Matters*: Loading the document prepares it for conversion.

#### Step 2: Configure HTML Conversion Options
Next, configure your conversion options. GroupDocs.Conversion provides `WebConvertOptions` specifically for converting documents to web-friendly formats like HTML.

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

*Why This Matters*: Configuring these options allows you to customize the output according to your needs.

#### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output as an HTML File
Finally, convert the document and save it as an HTML file in your desired location.

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "odt-converted-to.html");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

*Why This Matters*: The conversion process transforms the ODT document into a format suitable for web use.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your file paths are correct.
- Verify that you have write permissions to the output directory.
- Check if the necessary dependencies are installed and referenced correctly in your project.
