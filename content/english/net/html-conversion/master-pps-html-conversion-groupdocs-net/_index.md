## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the implementation:
### Feature Overview: Converting PPS to HTML
The primary function of this feature is converting PowerPoint presentations (.pps) into an interactive HTML format. This allows users to view slides on any device with a web browser.
#### Step 1: Load the Source File
First, load the PPS file using GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.pps")))
{
    // Conversion logic will follow here
}
```
**Why This Step?**
Loading the source file initializes the conversion process with your PowerPoint file.
#### Step 2: Configure HTML Conversion Options
Next, define settings for converting to HTML:
```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```
This configuration specifies a web-friendly format conversion.
#### Step 3: Define Output Path and Perform Conversion
Specify where to save your converted file and execute the conversion:
```csharp
string outputFileDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFileDirectory, "pps-converted-to.html");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
**Why This Step?**
Specifying the output path ensures organized and accessible converted HTML files.
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File not found errors.
  - Ensure file paths are correct and files exist at specified locations.
- **Conversion Fails**: Unsupported features in PPS.
