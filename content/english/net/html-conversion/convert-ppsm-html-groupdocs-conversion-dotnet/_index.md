## Implementation Guide

### Load and Convert PPSM File

#### Overview
The primary function of this feature is to load a PowerPoint Show file (PPSM) and convert it into an HTML format that can be easily embedded or displayed on web pages. This conversion enhances accessibility and shareability across different platforms.

#### Loading the Source PPSM File
**Step 1: Define Document Paths**
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ppsm-converted-to.html");
```
These lines set up your input directory and define where the converted HTML file will be saved.

#### Initialize Conversion Options
**Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```
The `WebConvertOptions` class is configured to convert documents into web-compatible formats like HTML.

#### Perform the Conversion
**Step 3: Execute Conversion Process**
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ppsm")))
{
    // Convert and save the output file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
This block of code handles loading the PPSM file and converting it to HTML using specified options.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File not found errors can occur if paths are incorrect.
  - **Solution**: Double-check directory paths in your setup.
