## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process into clear steps.

### Load Source CMX File

**Overview:** Loading your source file is the first step in any document conversion task. This ensures that GroupDocs.Conversion can access and interpret the CMX file correctly.

#### Step 1: Define the File Path
Define where your CMX file resides on your system:

```csharp
string cmxFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.cmx";
```

#### Step 2: Create a Converter Instance
Initialize the `Converter` class with the path to your CMX file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(cmxFilePath))
{
    // Further conversion steps will be added here.
}
```

### Convert CMX File to HTML Format

**Overview:** This step involves converting the loaded CMX file into an HTML format using `WebConvertOptions`.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Path
Define where you want to save your converted files:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "cmx-converted-to.html");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options for HTML format:

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Use the `Converter` instance to convert and save your file in HTML format:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(cmxFilePath))
{
    // Convert CMX to HTML and save it.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the CMX file path is correct.
