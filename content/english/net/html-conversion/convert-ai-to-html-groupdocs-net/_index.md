## Implementation Guide

We'll break down this guide into logical sections based on the features you need to implement.

### Load AI File

#### Overview
Loading an AI file is the first step in our conversion process. This section covers how to read and prepare your AI file for conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define Constants:**
Set up constants for directories where your files will be located.

```csharp
const string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

**2. Load the Source AI File:**
Load and initialize the file using the `Converter` class.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var aiFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY, "sample.ai");
        using (var converter = new Converter(aiFilePath))
        {
            // Conversion logic will be implemented here
        }
    }
}
```

### Convert AI to HTML

#### Overview
Converting an AI file into an HTML format opens up numerous possibilities for web integration. This section demonstrates how to perform the conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Setup Output Directory:**
Define where your converted files will be saved.

```csharp
const string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string outputFolder = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY;
        string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ai-converted-to.html");

        var aiFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY, "sample.ai");
        using (var converter = new Converter(aiFilePath))
        {
            // Set HTML conversion options
            var options = new WebConvertOptions();

            // Save converted HTML file
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Configuration Options
- **WebConvertOptions**: Customize how AI files are converted into HTML.
