## Implementation Guide

Now, let's walk through implementing the conversion process.

### Convert FODS File to HTML

This feature converts an OpenDocument Flat XML Spreadsheet (.fods) file into HTML format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Load and Prepare Your Document
Firstly, ensure your document is ready for conversion by specifying its path:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Path to the source FODS file
string sampleFodsPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.fods");
```

#### Convert Using GroupDocs.Conversion
Next, use the conversion functionalities provided by GroupDocs:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sampleFodsPath))
{
    var options = new WebConvertOptions(); // Configure to HTML format
    string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "fods-converted-to.html");

    // Perform the conversion and save the output file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Converter**: Loads your FODS file.
- **WebConvertOptions**: Specifies HTML as the target format.
- **converter.Convert()**: Executes the conversion process.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure `sample.fods` exists in your document directory.
- Verify that output paths are correctly specified and accessible.
