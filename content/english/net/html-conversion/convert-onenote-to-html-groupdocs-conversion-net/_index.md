## Introduction

Need to share a Microsoft OneNote file but your recipient lacks access? Easily convert `.one` files into HTML format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This format is universally viewable in web browsers, making sharing straightforward.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through converting OneNote documents to HTML with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By the end, you will understand how to convert `.one` files to HTML using C#. Here's what you'll learn:

Letâ€™s start by covering the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following:

- **GroupDocs.Conversion Library**: Version 25.3.0 or later is required.
- **Environment Setup**: A .NET environment (preferably .NET Core or .NET Framework) set up on your machine.
- **Knowledge Requirements**: Basic understanding of C# and familiarity with NuGet package management.

### Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Install the GroupDocs.Conversion library using either the Package Manager Console or .NET CLI:

**Using NuGet Package Manager Console:**

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**Using .NET CLI:**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

After installation, obtain a license if you plan to use it beyond the trial period by getting a free trial or temporary license from GroupDocs.

Include the necessary namespace in your project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading the Source OneNote File

First, load your `.one` file using C#:

#### Step 1: Define Document Paths

Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` and `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` with your actual directory paths.

```csharp
string yourDocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string sampleOneFilePath = Path.Combine(yourDocumentDirectory, "sample.one");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter

Load the `.one` file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sampleOneFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

### Converting OneNote to HTML

With your OneNote file loaded, proceed with converting it to HTML.

#### Step 3: Configure WebConvertOptions

Specify the conversion options for HTML output:

```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Define Output Path and Convert

Ensure your output directory exists, then save the converted file:

```csharp
string yourOutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
if (!Directory.Exists(yourOutputDirectory))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(yourOutputDirectory);
}
string outputFile = Path.Combine(yourOutputDirectory, "one-converted-to.html");

// Perform conversion
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Practical Applications

Converting OneNote files to HTML is useful for:

1. **Collaboration**: Share notes with team members who don't have OneNote.
2. **Web Publishing**: Publish your notes online for a broader audience.
3. **Backup**: Keep an accessible backup of your notes in a widely supported format.

To optimize performance while using GroupDocs.Conversion:
