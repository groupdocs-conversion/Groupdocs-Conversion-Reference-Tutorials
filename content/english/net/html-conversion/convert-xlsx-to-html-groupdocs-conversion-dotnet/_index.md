        Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion initialized!");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's walk through the process of converting XLSX to HTML using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

First, specify where you want to save your converted HTML file. This involves defining an output directory and constructing a path for the HTML file.

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual output directory path
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlsx-converted-to.html");
```

### Step 2: Load the Source XLSX File

Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your XLSX file. This step prepares your document for conversion.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.xlsx")) // Replace with your actual document directory and file path
{
    // Proceed to the next steps here...
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up HTML Conversion Options

Configure options for converting your document into HTML format. Here, you can specify various settings tailored to your needs.

```csharp
var options = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert.WebConvertOptions();
```

### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion process using the configured options. The resulting file will be saved in the specified output directory.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully!");
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure your XLSX file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that the output folder exists or create it programmatically if needed.
- Check for any missing dependencies in your project setup.
