- **GroupDocs.Conversion Library:** Version 25.3.0 as used in this tutorial
- **C# Knowledge:** Basic understanding of C# and familiarity with NuGet package management

Prepare an OTS file for conversion and a directory to store the output HTML files.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Install the GroupDocs.Conversion library in your project using one of these methods:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**

- **Free Trial:** Start with no-cost access.
- **Temporary License:** Apply for advanced features temporarily by getting a free license.
- **Purchase:** Consider purchasing if you find it valuable.

Once installed, initialize the library in your C# project. Here's how to set up basic initialization:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Basic setup and loading of an OTS file
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.ots";
var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
converter.Dispose();
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading Source OTS File

This feature demonstrates how to load your .ots file using the GroupDocs.Conversion library.

#### Step 1: Define Document Path

Specify the location of your OTS file:
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.ots";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter Object

Load the OTS file into a `Converter` object to prepare it for conversion.
```csharp
var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
// Always dispose of resources when done to free up memory
converter.Dispose();
```

### Setting Conversion Options for HTML

To convert your OTS file into an HTML document, set appropriate conversion options.

#### Step 1: Create Conversion Options Instance

Instantiate `WebConvertOptions` for web-friendly format conversions like HTML:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var htmlConversionOptions = new WebConvertOptions();
```

### Convert OTS to HTML and Save Output

Now, let's perform the conversion and save your output file.

#### Step 1: Define Output Path

Set up where you want to store the converted HTML file:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ots-converted-to.html");
```

#### Step 2: Perform Conversion

Use the `Converter` instance to convert and save your document in HTML format.
```csharp
using (var converterInstance = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    converterInstance.Convert(outputFile, htmlConversionOptions);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues:** Ensure paths are correct and accessible.
- **Library Version Compatibility:** Use the specified version to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Resource Management:** Dispose of `Converter` objects properly to manage memory usage efficiently.

## Practical Applications
