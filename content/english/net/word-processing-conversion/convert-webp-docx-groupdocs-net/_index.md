## Implementation Guide

### Convert WebP to DOCX Feature

This feature allows you to convert images in the WebP format into editable Word documents. Follow these steps to implement it:

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Paths
Define where your converted files will be saved.

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "webp-converted-to.docx");
```

**Explanation:** `Path.Combine` ensures the paths are correctly formatted across different operating systems.

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the WebP File

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.webp")))
{
    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:** 
- **Converter:** Initializes with a source file path.
- **WordProcessingConvertOptions:** Configures the conversion to DOCX format.
- **converter.Convert:** Executes the conversion process.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure the source WebP file exists in the specified directory.
- Check for any permission issues on the output directory.
- Validate that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and referenced.

This functionality can be invaluable in several scenarios:

1. **Archiving:** Convert image archives into DOCX format for easier access and editing.
2. **Document Preparation:** Integrate images seamlessly into documents for presentations or reports.
3. **Data Migration:** Facilitate the transfer of visual data from WebP to Word environments.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

- Use asynchronous methods where possible to improve responsiveness.
- Limit memory usage by processing files in batches when handling large datasets.

### Best Practices

- Dispose of `Converter` instances promptly to free up resources.
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Conversion to benefit from performance enhancements and bug fixes.
