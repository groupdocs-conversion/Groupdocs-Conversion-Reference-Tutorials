### Environment Setup Requirements:
- A suitable development environment like Visual Studio
- Basic knowledge of C# programming and understanding of document formats
### Knowledge Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with LaTeX (.tex) files and Word documents (.doc)
Once you've covered these prerequisites, we can proceed to set up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
To begin converting your LaTeX documents, first install the GroupDocs.Conversion library. Hereâ€™s how:
### NuGet Package Manager Console
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```
### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```
#### License Acquisition:
- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to test the library's capabilities.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing a full license for ongoing use.
Once installed, initialize and set up GroupDocs.Conversion in your project:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
// Define the paths for input and output files
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Set your desired output directory path
string inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.tex"; // Path to the input .tex file
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "tex-converted-to.doc"); // Output file path
// Load the source TEX file using GroupDocs.Conversion
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile)) 
{
    WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
    // Convert and save the DOC file to the specified output path
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
## Implementation Guide
### Overview of Features
This guide walks you through converting LaTeX files into Word documents using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. We'll cover each step in detail for a smooth implementation.
#### Step 1: Configure Your Environment
Ensure your project has access to the necessary libraries and dependencies, as detailed above.
#### Step 2: Prepare File Paths
Define paths for both input (LaTeX) and output (Word) files. Adjust these according to your directory structure:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.tex";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "tex-converted-to.doc");
```
#### Step 3: Initialize the Converter
Create an instance of the `Converter` class and configure it with your input file path. This setup is crucial for processing the document:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here.
}
```
#### Step 4: Configure Conversion Options
Set up conversion options to specify that you're converting to a Word document format:
```csharp
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
```
