// Define paths for your document directories
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Specify the source MPT file path and output DOCX file path
string mptFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mpt");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mpt-converted-to.docx");

// Initialize the converter with your file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(mptFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert MPT to DOCX

This feature allows you to convert an MPT presentation into a DOCX document, leveraging GroupDocs.Conversion's powerful capabilities.

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(mptFilePath))
{
    // Proceed to set conversion options in the next steps
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options for Word Processing

Define how the file should be converted by specifying `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.

```csharp
// Create options for word processing format conversion
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```
