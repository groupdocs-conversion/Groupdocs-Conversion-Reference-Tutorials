## Implementation Guide
### Load and Convert EPS File to DOCX
This section guides you through loading an EPS file and converting it into a DOCX format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Specify the paths for your source EPS file and output directory:
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.eps");
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "eps-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source File
Load your EPS file using GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here
}
```
*Why this step?*
Loading the source file initializes the conversion process, allowing you to apply further configurations.

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Define the output format using WordProcessingConvertOptions:
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```
*What are these parameters for?*
They specify that the target document should be in a Word processing format (DOCX).

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the DOCX file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Files:** Ensure your EPS file path is correct.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify write permissions for the output directory.
