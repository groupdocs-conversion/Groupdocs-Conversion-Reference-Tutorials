## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert WMZ to DOCX

This feature allows you to seamlessly transform a WMZ file into a DOCX format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Define Directories and Load Source File
Start by defining your document directories and loading the source WMZ file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";

// Load the source WMZ file
group (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.wmz")))
{
    Console.WriteLine("WMZ file loaded successfully.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options for Word Processing formats:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();

// Define output path for DOCX
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "wmz-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion from WMZ to DOCX and handle any potential issues:

```csharp
try
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
    Console.WriteLine("Conversion successful. Output saved at: " + outputFile);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error during conversion: " + ex.Message);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors**: Ensure paths are correct and directories exist.
- **Version Compatibility**: Confirm compatibility with .NET and GroupDocs.Conversion versions.

## Practical Applications
1. **Automated Document Management Systems**: Streamline workflows by integrating conversion features.
