        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Load Source J2C File
**Overview:** This feature allows you to load a JPEG 2000 image file, preparing it for conversion.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Specify the J2C File Path:**
   Set the path where your source J2C file is located:

   ```csharp
   string j2cFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.j2c";
   ```

2. **Initialize the Converter Object:**
   Create a `Converter` instance to manage the conversion process:

   ```csharp
   using (var converter = new Converter(j2cFilePath))
   {
       // Conversion logic will be performed here.
   }
   ```

3. **Explain Parameters and Methods:**
The constructor of the `Converter` class takes a file path, initializing the object for subsequent operations.

### Convert J2C to DOCX Format
**Overview:** This feature converts your loaded J2C file into a Microsoft Word Open XML Document format (.docx).

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Set Output Directory and File Name:**
   Define where you want to save the converted document:

   ```csharp
   string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "j2c-converted-to.docx");
   ```

2. **Specify Conversion Options:**
   Use `WordProcessingConvertOptions` for DOCX conversion:

   ```csharp
   var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
   ```

3. **Perform the Conversion:**
   Convert and save the output file to your specified path:

   ```csharp
   using (var converter = new Converter(j2cFilePath))
   {
       converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
   }
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting Tips:**
