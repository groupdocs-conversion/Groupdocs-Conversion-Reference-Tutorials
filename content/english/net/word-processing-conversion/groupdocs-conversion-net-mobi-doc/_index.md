### Feature: Convert Mobi to Docx

#### Overview
This feature demonstrates how you can convert a MOBI file into DOCX format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. It's particularly useful in scenarios where document compatibility and formatting are crucial.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Start by setting up the paths for your input MOBI file and output DOCX file:

```csharp
string sourceMobiFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mobi");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mobi-converted-to.docx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the MOBI File
Utilize GroupDocs.Conversion to load your Mobi file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceMobiFilePath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("MOBI file loaded successfully.");
}

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

### Feature: Setup Directories

#### Overview
Ensure that your directories for input files and output results are correctly set up to avoid file path errors.

#### Step 1: Create Output Directory if Not Exists
Check and create the necessary directory structure:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
