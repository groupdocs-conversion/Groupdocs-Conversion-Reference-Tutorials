```

## Implementation Guide

This section will break down the process into manageable steps, detailing each feature.

### Load Source File
#### Overview
The first step is loading your XLSX file for conversion. This prepares your document for subsequent processing tasks.

#### Steps
**1. Set Document Directory**
Start by specifying where your source files reside:

```csharp
string dataDir = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\/";
```

**2. Load the File**
Use the `Converter` class to load the XLSX file. This step ensures that the document is ready for conversion.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(dataDir + "sample.xlsx"))
{
    // The file is now loaded and available for conversion.
}
```

### Convert XLSX to DOCX
#### Overview
After loading your source file, converting it into a Word document (DOCX format) involves setting specific options.

#### Steps
**1. Set Output Directory**
Define where the converted files will be saved:

```csharp
string outputDir = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\/";
```

**2. Define Output File Path**
Combine directory and filename for clarity:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDir, "xlsx-converted-to.docx");
```

**3. Set Conversion Options**
Specify the desired format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(dataDir + "sample.xlsx"))
{
    var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
    
    // Convert and save to DOCX
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

#### Explanation of Parameters
