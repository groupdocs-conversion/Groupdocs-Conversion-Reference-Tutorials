string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

try
{
    using (Converter converter = new Converter(logFilePath))
    {
        var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
        
        // Convert LOG to DOCX
        string docxOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output.docx");
        converter.Convert(docxOutputPath, options);
        
        Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully!");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview

This section focuses on converting a LOG file to DOCX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. We'll break down the steps and explain each part of the process.

#### Step 1: Initialize Converter

Start by creating an instance of `Converter` with your LOG file path. This object will handle the conversion process.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(logFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure Convert Options

Set up the conversion options using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`. These options allow you to customize how your LOG file is converted into DOCX format.

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Call the `Convert` method, passing in the output path and conversion options. This step will generate the DOCX file from your LOG data.

```csharp
converter.Convert(docxOutputPath, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues:** Ensure that both input and output paths are correctly specified.
- **Permissions:** Check if you have read/write permissions for the directories involved.
- **Library Version:** Use version 25.3.0 to avoid compatibility issues.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion isn't just limited to converting LOG files to DOCX. Here are some real-world use cases:

1. **Automated Report Generation:** Convert server logs into detailed reports for analysis.
2. **Data Sharing:** Share application logs with non-technical stakeholders in a readable format.
3. **Integration with Document Management Systems:** Seamlessly integrate converted documents into systems like SharePoint or OneDrive.
