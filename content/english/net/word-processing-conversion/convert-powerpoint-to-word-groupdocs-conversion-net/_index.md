## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process into steps:

### Load and Convert PPT to DOC

#### Overview
This feature allows you to convert PowerPoint files into Word documents, enabling seamless content editing and formatting.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define Directories**
Set up constants for input and output directories:
```csharp
const string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
const string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
```

**2. Specify Output Path**
Combine the output directory with a filename to define where the converted document will be saved.
```csharp
string outputFolder = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY;
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ppt-converted-to.doc");
```

**3. Load the Source PPT File**
Use the `Converter` class to load your PowerPoint file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(System.IO.Path.Combine(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY, "sample.ppt")))
{
    Console.WriteLine("PPT file loaded successfully.");
}
```

**4. Set Conversion Options**
Configure conversion options for Word Processing formats:
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
```

**5. Perform the Conversion**
Execute the conversion and save the output DOC file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
