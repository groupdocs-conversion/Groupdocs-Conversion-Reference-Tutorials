### Load and Convert POTM File

#### Overview
We’ll load a POTM file and convert it to the DOC format using GroupDocs.Conversion. This process involves specifying conversion options and executing the conversion method.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define Document Paths**
Start by defining paths for your input POTM file and output DOC file:

```csharp
const string DocumentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
const string OutputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
```

**2. Initialize Converter**
Load the POTM file into a GroupDocs.Conversion object:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Path.Combine(DocumentDirectory, "sample.potm")))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

**3. Set Conversion Options**
Specify options to convert the document to DOC format:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

**4. Perform Conversion**
Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(OutputDirectory, "potm-converted-to.doc");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
