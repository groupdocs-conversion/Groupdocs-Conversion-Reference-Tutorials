### Feature: File Conversion from OTT to DOC

This feature showcases how to convert an Open Document Template file into Microsoft Word format.

#### Step 1: Prepare the Environment

Ensure your directories are correctly set up. Define paths for input and output:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source OTT File

Begin by loading the source .ott file using GroupDocs.Conversion’s `Converter` class:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "your-file.ott")))
{
    // Conversion logic follows...
}
```

This code snippet loads your document for conversion.

#### Step 3: Define Conversion Options

Specify the target format and options for the DOC file:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
```

The `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class allows you to set various parameters like file format.

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output DOC file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ott-converted-to.doc"), options);
```

This step writes your converted document to the specified directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues during conversion:
- Ensure file paths are correctly defined.
- Check that all dependencies and versions match what's required.
- Verify permissions for reading source files and writing output files.
