**Set Input and Output Paths:**
Define paths for the input PSD file and the output DOCX file:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.psd";
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "psd-converted-to.docx");
```

**Specify Conversion Options:**
Indicate the conversion to Word processing format (DOCX):
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

**Perform the Conversion:**
Save the converted DOCX file using the specified options:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
