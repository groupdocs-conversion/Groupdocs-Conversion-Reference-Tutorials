## Implementation Guide

### Conversion Overview

This section details converting a JPEG 2000 Image File (.jpx) into a Word Document (.doc) using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Process

##### Load the Source JPX File
Start by loading your source JPX file:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.jpx");
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
**Explanation**: The `Converter` class initializes with the path to your JPX file, setting up the conversion context.

##### Configure Conversion Options
Set up options for converting into a Word Processing format:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
```
**Explanation**: Specify that our target format is DOC by setting `Format` to `WordProcessingFileType.Doc`.

##### Convert and Save the File
Execute the conversion and save it as a DOC file:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jpx-converted-to.doc");

// Perform conversion
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
**Explanation**: The `Convert` method takes in the destination path and configured options to save your file as a DOC.

##### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your input file path is correct.
- Verify that the output directory exists or create it programmatically.
