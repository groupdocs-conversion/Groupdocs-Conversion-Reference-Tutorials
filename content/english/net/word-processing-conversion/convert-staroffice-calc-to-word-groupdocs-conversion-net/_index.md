## Implementation Guide

### Convert SXC to DOC

Convert StarOffice Calc Spreadsheet files into Microsoft Word documents using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Environment
Set up necessary paths in your environment:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.sxc");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "sxc-converted-to.doc");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source SXC File
Load your file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```
This snippet initializes a `Converter` object with your SXC file, ready for conversion.

#### Step 3: Define Conversion Options
Specify the output format using GroupDocs.Conversion options:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
```
Here, you configure the desired output format as DOC.

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the result to your specified directory:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This line performs the actual file transformation and outputs a DOC document in your designated folder.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing File Errors:** Ensure paths are correct and files exist.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify write permissions for the output directory.
- **Library Version Mismatch:** Confirm compatibility of GroupDocs versions.
