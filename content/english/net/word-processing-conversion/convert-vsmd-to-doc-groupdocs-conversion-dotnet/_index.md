## Implementation Guide

### Load VSDM File
**Overview**
Loading a VSDM file is the first step in conversion. This section covers how to initialize your file for further processing.

#### Step 1: Set Your Source Document Path
Specify where your VSDM file resides:

```csharp
string vsdmFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/vsdm-file.vsdm";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter
Create a converter instance to manage the conversion process:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(vsdmFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added in subsequent steps.
}
```

### Set Word Processing Convert Options
**Overview**
To convert your document into a DOC format, configure specific options that define how the conversion should proceed.

#### Step 1: Define Conversion Options
Set up `WordProcessingConvertOptions` for the desired output format:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Specify the target format as DOC
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc 
};
```

### Convert VSDM to DOC
**Overview**
This section focuses on performing the conversion and saving the output file in DOC format.

#### Step 1: Set Output Path
Determine where your converted document will be saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vsdm-converted-to.doc");
```

#### Step 2: Execute Conversion
Perform the conversion using the initialized converter and defined options:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(vsdmFilePath)) 
{
    // Convert VSDM to DOC and save to output path
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
