        string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
        string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

        // Initialize the converter with the source MHTML file path
        using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mhtml")))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Convert MHTML to DOC Feature
#### Overview
The primary feature we'll implement is converting an MHTML file into a Microsoft Word Document (DOC). This section details each step required for this transformation using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### Load the Source MHTML File
To begin, load your source MHTML file. Ensure that the path to the file is correctly specified.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Define paths for input and output directories
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Initialize the converter with the source MHTML file
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mhtml")))
{
    Console.WriteLine("MHTML file loaded.");
}
```

##### Define Conversion Options for DOC Format
Next, specify the conversion options. Here we set it to convert to Word Processing formats, specifically `.doc`.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define conversion options for the DOC format
WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions 
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

##### Convert and Save the MHTML File as a DOC File
Finally, perform the conversion and save the output to your desired directory.

```csharp
// Define the output file path for the converted document
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mhtml-converted-to.doc");

// Execute the conversion
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);

Console.WriteLine($"MHTML successfully converted to DOC: {outputFile}");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that both input and output directories are correctly specified.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library is properly installed and referenced in your project.
- If encountering file access errors, check for sufficient permissions on the paths involved.

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Conversion isn't just limited to MHTML-to-DOC conversions. Here are some real-world use cases:
1. **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Automatically converting archived web pages (MHTML) into editable Word documents for content editing.
2. **Legal and Compliance:** Transforming email archives in MHTML format into DOC files for legal reviews or compliance checks.
3. **Publishing Industry:** Converting draft articles saved as MHTML by journalists into Word formats for editorial processes.
