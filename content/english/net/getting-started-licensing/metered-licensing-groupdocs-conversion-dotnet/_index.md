# Implementing Metered Licensing with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Looking to manage software licenses efficiently while using the robust document conversion capabilities of GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET? This guide will help you set up a metered license, ensuring you only pay for what you use. By integrating metered licensing into your applications, you gain better control over costs and usage.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to implement metered licensing with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
- Steps for initializing and configuring GroupDocs.Conversion in .NET
- Practical examples of document conversion scenarios

Let's review the prerequisites needed before you start implementing this feature.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure that you have:
1. **Required Libraries & Dependencies:**
   - GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET version 25.3.0 or higher
   - .NET Framework (4.6.1) or .NET Core/Standard compatible with your project setup

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Visual Studio installed on your system
   - Access to a development environment capable of running .NET applications

3. **Knowledge Prerequisites:**
   - Basic understanding of C# and .NET framework concepts
   - Familiarity with package management in .NET, such as NuGet or the .NET CLI

With these prerequisites checked off your list, let's move on to setting up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To get started, install GroupDocs.Conversion via the NuGet Package Manager Console or using the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

To fully utilize GroupDocs.Conversion, consider acquiring a license:
- **Free Trial:** Start with the free trial to evaluate functionalities.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** For full access and support, purchase a license.

#### Basic Initialization

Here's a quick setup guide in C#:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize conversion handler
class ConversionHandler
{
    private readonly Converter _converter;

    public ConversionHandler(string documentPath)
    {
        // Initialize converter with the path to your document
        _converter = new Converter(documentPath);

        // Set up your licensing if you have one
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense("GroupDocs.Total.lic");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Implement Metered Licensing

This feature allows setting a metered license using the GroupDocs API, enabling cost-effective usage.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Metered Class

First, initialize the `Metered` class responsible for managing your metered licenses:
```csharp
using System;

// Create an instance of Metered
class MeteredLicenseManager
{
    private readonly Metered _metered;

    public MeteredLicenseManager()
    {
        // Initialize the Metered class
        _metered = new Metered();
    }
}
```
**Why?** Initializing this class is crucial as it connects your application to GroupDocs' licensing server for metering.

#### Step 2: Set the Metered License Keys

Configure your public and private keys using `SetMeteredKey`, which are essential for secure license management:
```csharp
// Set your unique metered license keys
class MeteredConfiguration
{
    private readonly Metered _metered;

    public MeteredConfiguration(string publicKey, string privateKey)
    {
        _metered = new Metered();
        _metered.SetMeteredKey(publicKey, privateKey);
    }
}
```
**Parameters:**
- `publicKey`: Your GroupDocs public key.
- `privateKey`: Your GroupDocs private key, ensuring authentication and authorization.

#### Step 3: Implement Key Configuration Options

Customize your license settings based on application needs:
```csharp
// Example of additional configuration (pseudo-code)
class MeteredOptionsConfiguration
{
    public void ConfigureMeteredOptions(Metered metered)
    {
        // Adjust the MaxUsage parameter to align with expected document processing volume
        metered.ConfigureOptions(options =>
        {
            options.MaxUsage = 1000; // Set maximum usage limit
        });
    }
}
```
**Tip:** Adjust the `MaxUsage` parameter based on your business requirements.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your keys are correctly entered and have not expired.
- Verify network connectivity if license verification fails.
- Check for any API changes in GroupDocsâ€™ documentation that may affect configuration.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world scenarios where metered licensing can be beneficial:
1. **Subscription-Based Services:** Businesses providing document conversion as a service can track usage and bill clients accordingly.
2. **Internal Document Management Systems:** Organizations processing large volumes of documents internally can manage costs effectively.
3. **Integration with CRM Tools:** Enhance customer relationship management systems by incorporating metered licensing for on-demand conversions.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance when using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- Minimize memory usage by disposing objects promptly after conversion tasks.
- Use asynchronous programming models to handle multiple document conversions efficiently.
- Regularly update your GroupDocs library to leverage the latest performance improvements and bug fixes.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to implement metered licensing with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This setup helps you manage costs while aligning usage with business needs. To explore more features, consider experimenting with different document formats or integrating additional functionalities within your applications.

**Next Steps:** Try implementing these configurations in a test project and observe how they fit into your workflow.
