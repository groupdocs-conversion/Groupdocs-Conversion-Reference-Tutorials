This tutorial provides clear, step-by-step instructions on setting up your GroupDocs.Conversion license using both file and stream methods. Perfect for integrating this robust conversion tool into your .NET applications.

**What You'll Learn:**
- How to configure GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET effectively.
- Step-by-step guidance on applying a license from a file or a stream.
- Common troubleshooting tips for licensing issues.
- Best practices for optimizing performance with GroupDocs.Conversion.

Let's start by reviewing the prerequisites needed for this tutorial.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**: Ensure you have version 25.3.0 or later.
  
### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment capable of running .NET applications (e.g., Visual Studio).

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming.
- Familiarity with file handling and stream operations in .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Conversion, you need to install it. Follow these steps:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

Before implementing license functionality, you need to acquire a license:
- **Free Trial**: Get started with a free trial from the GroupDocs site.
- **Temporary License**: Request a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Buy a permanent license if your project requires long-term use.

Once acquired, store your `License.lic` file in an accessible directory within your project.

## Implementation Guide

This section covers two main features: setting the license from a file and from a stream.

### Feature 1: Set License from File

**Overview**: Configure GroupDocs.Conversion using a license file to unlock full functionality.

#### Step 1: Check for License Existence
Ensure your license file exists at the specified path before applying it.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Licensing;

if (File.Exists("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\License.lic"))
{
    // Proceed to set the license
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("We do not ship any license with this example. " +
                      "Visit the GroupDocs site to obtain either a temporary or permanent license. " +
                      "Learn more about licensing at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/faqs/licensing. " +
                      "Learn how to request a temporary license at https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Set License
Create an instance of the `License` class and apply your license using its full path.
```csharp
License license = new License();
license.SetLicense("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\License.lic");
```

### Feature 2: Stream License Configuration

**Overview**: Set a GroupDocs.Conversion license using an embedded resource stream.

#### Step 1: Load Embedded Resource
Open the embedded license file as a stream from your assembly resources.
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Reflection;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Licensing;

Stream licenseStream = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY.GroupDocs.License.lic");
if (licenseStream != null)
{
    // Proceed to set the license using the stream
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("The embedded license resource could not be found. Please ensure it is correctly added as a resource in your project.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply License from Stream
Use the `License` class to apply the license via the stream.
```csharp
License license = new License();
license.SetLicense(licenseStream);
```
