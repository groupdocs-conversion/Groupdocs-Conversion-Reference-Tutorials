### Converting EMLX Files to DOC Format

#### Overview
This feature allows seamless transformation of email content from EMLX to DOC, facilitating manipulation and sharing using common word processing tools.

##### Step 1: Load the EMLX File
Start by loading your EMLX file into a `Converter` object. This step prepares the file for conversion.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your/file.emlx"))
{
    // Conversion logic will follow here...
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Up DOC Conversion Options
Define options for converting to DOC format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var convertOptions = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

These options allow you to specify settings like page size, margins, and more, based on your requirements.

##### Step 3: Execute the Conversion
Invoke the conversion process with a specified output path for the DOC file.

```csharp
converter.Convert("output/path/output.doc", convertOptions);
```
This method call performs the actual conversion, saving the result as a DOC file at the designated location.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors:** Ensure input and output paths are correct and accessible.
- **Permission Issues:** Verify that your application has read/write permissions for the directories involved.
- **Unsupported Features:** Some email features may not convert perfectly. Test with various EMLX files to understand limitations.
