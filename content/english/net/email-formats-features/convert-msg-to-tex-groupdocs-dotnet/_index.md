### Implementation Guide
Let's break down the implementation into key steps:
#### Feature 1: Loading a File
**Overview**: This feature focuses on loading your source MSG file using GroupDocs.Conversion.
##### Step 1: Load the MSG File
First, set up your input path and load the file.
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Set your document directory path here
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.msg";

// Load the MSG file
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // The 'converter' object is now ready for further operations.
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- `Converter` class from GroupDocs.Conversion library handles file loading. 
- Replace "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.msg" with your actual file path.
#### Feature 2: Setting Conversion Options
**Overview**: Configure the conversion options to transform the MSG file into TEX format.
##### Step 2: Create and Set Conversion Options
Define conversion settings for the target format.
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define a class for converting options
class PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions : ConvertOptions
{
    public PageDescriptionLanguageFileType Format { get; set; }
}

// Set conversion format to TEX
PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions()
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Tex
};
```
**Explanation**: 
- `PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions` class specifies the desired output format.
- The option `Format` is set to TEX, ensuring our conversion targets this file type.
#### Feature 3: Saving a Converted File
**Overview**: Save your converted document as a TEX file using GroupDocs.Conversion.
##### Step 3: Save the Converted File
Finalize and save the conversion result.
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Set your output directory path here
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "msg-converted-to.tex");

// Re-load the converter for demonstration purposes
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Save the converted TEX file using previously set options
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
**Explanation**: 
- `outputFile` specifies where to save your converted document.
- Ensure "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY" is correctly set.
