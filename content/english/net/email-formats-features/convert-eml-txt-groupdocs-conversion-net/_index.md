using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the conversion library with licensing details if available.
        Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is ready to use.");
    }
}
```
With your environment set up, let's delve into implementing EML to TXT conversion.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert EML to TXT
This feature allows you to convert an EML file into a more manageable TXT format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths
Start by setting the paths for your input and output directories. This helps your application know where to read from and write to.
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Specify your EML file directory
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Specify your TXT output directory

// Define file names
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.eml");
        string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "eml-converted-to.txt");
    }
}
```
#### Step 2: Load the Source EML File
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your source EML file.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion options will be defined in the next step.
}
```
*Why use `using`? It ensures resources are disposed of properly once conversion is complete.*

#### Step 3: Define Conversion Options
Configure your conversion to output as a TXT file using specific format settings.
```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = FileType.Txt };
```
*The `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class provides various configuration parameters, allowing you to specify the desired output format.*

#### Step 4: Convert and Save
Perform the conversion and save your TXT file with the configured settings.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion version matches your project's dependencies.
  
## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world use cases where EML to TXT conversion can be beneficial:
1. **Data Migration**: Converting archived emails for easier integration with databases or other applications.
2. **Email Analytics**: Extracting plain text from EML files to analyze email content using text processing tools.
3. **Backup Solutions**: Simplifying backup processes by converting emails into a more lightweight format.

These conversions can easily integrate with various .NET frameworks, enhancing your application's functionality.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance while using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- Monitor resource usage to prevent bottlenecks during large batch processing.
- Manage memory efficiently by disposing of objects once they're no longer needed.

Employing these best practices will help maintain smooth operation and reliability in your applications.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned how to convert EML files to TXT format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This capability can streamline many aspects of email data management, from migration projects to analytics tasks.
