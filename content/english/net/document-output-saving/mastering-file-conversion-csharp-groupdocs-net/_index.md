### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project like so:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Initialize a new instance of Converter class with input file path
var converter = new Converter("sample.pdf");

// Set up conversion options (e.g., converting to DOCX)
var convertOptions = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

This snippet sets the stage for converting files from PDF to DOCX. Let's delve into implementing specific features.

## Implementation Guide

### Document Conversion

#### Overview
Converting documents is a fundamental feature of GroupDocs.Conversion, allowing you to transform file types easily within your applications.

**Step 1: Loading the Source File**

Begin by loading the source file using the `Converter` class:

```csharp
// Load the document into Converter instance
using (var converter = new Converter("input.docx"))
{
    // Proceed with conversion settings
}
```

*Why this step?* Loading the document is crucial for accessing its properties and preparing it for conversion.

**Step 2: Setting Conversion Options**

Define your target format using specific conversion options:

```csharp
// Set up WordProcessingConvertOptions for DOCX output
var convertOptions = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

This step configures how the document should be converted, including setting the desired output format.

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure that file paths are correct and accessible to avoid loading errors.

### Image Processing

#### Overview
GroupDocs.Conversion supports image conversions, making it easy to adapt your applications for multimedia tasks.

**Step 1: Choose Conversion Format**

Select an appropriate conversion option for images:

```csharp
// Configure options for image conversion (e.g., PNG)
var convertOptions = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Png };
```

*Why this step?* Specifying the format ensures that the output meets your project requirements.

**Step 2: Execute Conversion**

Perform the actual conversion using the `Convert` method:

```csharp
// Convert and save the image to a specified path
converter.Convert("output.png", convertOptions);
```

This command initiates the conversion process, producing an image in the desired format.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion can be integrated into various real-world scenarios. Here are a few examples:
