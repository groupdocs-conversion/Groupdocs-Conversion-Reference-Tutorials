2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have a compatible .NET framework installed.
3. **Knowledge Prerequisites**: A basic understanding of C# and .NET application development is necessary.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start using GroupDocs.Conversion, follow these steps to add the library to your project:

### Using NuGet Package Manager Console

```shell
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### Using .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

#### License Acquisition Steps
- **Free Trial**: Begin with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase**: Consider purchasing if the library meets your long-term needs.

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how you can initialize the GroupDocs.Conversion library:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Set up the file path for the JLS document
double documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.jls";

// Initialize the converter with the document path
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // The converter object is now ready to use.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load a JPEG Lossless Image File (.jls)

**Overview**: This section demonstrates how to load your JLS file using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter Object

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

double documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.jls";

// Create a converter instance with the document path
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Now, the converter object holds your JLS file.
}
```

**Explanation**: The `Converter` class is initialized with the path to your JLS file, setting up the groundwork for conversion operations.

### Convert a JLS File

**Overview**: Learn how to convert your loaded JLS file into another format, like PDF or PNG.

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define conversion options (e.g., converting to PDF)
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```

**Explanation**: This snippet sets up the desired output format using specific convert options. Customize these based on your needs.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

```csharp
string outputPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\output.pdf";

// Convert and save the document
converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
```

**Explanation**: Here, you're performing the actual conversion and saving the output to a specified path. Adjust `outputPath` as needed.
