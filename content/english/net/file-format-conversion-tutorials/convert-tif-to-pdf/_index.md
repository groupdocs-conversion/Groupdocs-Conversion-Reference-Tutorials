### Basic Familiarity with C#
A fundamental understanding of C# programming language is necessary to follow along with the conversion process.

Before proceeding with the conversion, make sure to import the required namespaces into your C# project. These namespaces will provide access to the functionalities needed for document conversion.
```csharp

using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Paths

string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "tif-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the desired directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load Source TIF File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_TIF))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_TIF` with the path to your source TIF file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Here, you can customize conversion options according to your requirements. For example, setting up page size, margins, etc.
## Step 4: Perform Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This line triggers the actual conversion process, converting the TIF file to PDF format.
## Step 5: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message confirms the successful completion of the conversion process and provides the path to the converted PDF file.
