# Convert TEX to PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of document management and manipulation, converting files from one format to another is a common necessity. Whether you're dealing with text documents, spreadsheets, or presentations, having the ability to seamlessly switch between formats can significantly enhance productivity and streamline workflows.
One powerful tool for handling such conversions in the .NET environment is GroupDocs.Conversion. This robust library provides developers with the capability to convert various document formats effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll focus on a specific conversion task: converting TEX files to PDF format.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. Installing GroupDocs.Conversion Library
To get started, you need to have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. If you haven't already installed it, you can download it from the [download page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Understanding the TEX Format
It's essential to have a basic understanding of the TEX file format. TEX is a typesetting system designed to handle complex mathematical expressions and produce high-quality documents. Familiarize yourself with the structure and content of TEX files before proceeding with the conversion.
### 3. Setting Up a .NET Project
Ensure that you have a .NET project set up where you'll be integrating the GroupDocs.Conversion library. If you haven't created a project yet, now is the time to do so.

## Import Namespaces
Before we delve into the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Path
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "tex-converted-to.pdf");
```
In this step, we specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure that you provide the correct directory path.
## Step 2: Load the Source TEX File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_TEX))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Here, we initialize a new instance of the GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter class, passing the path to the source TEX file as an argument.
## Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
In this step, we create an instance of PdfConvertOptions, which allows us to specify any additional settings for the PDF conversion. For now, we'll stick with the default options.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This line of code triggers the actual conversion process. The converter.Convert() method takes the output file path and conversion options as parameters.
## Step 5: Display Conversion Status
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.\nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Finally, we provide feedback to the user, informing them that the conversion process has been completed successfully and indicating the location where the converted PDF file can be found.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've explored how to convert TEX files to PDF format using the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide and ensuring that all prerequisites are met, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, enhancing their document processing capabilities.
