# Convert PST to PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of document management, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is paramount. Whether you're dealing with emails, spreadsheets, or presentations, having a reliable tool for conversion can streamline workflows and enhance productivity. In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to convert PST (Personal Storage Table) files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on the journey of converting PST to PDF, let's ensure we have everything we need:
### 1. Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Firstly, ensure you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the necessary files from the provided [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Obtain Source PST File
You'll need a sample PST file to perform the conversion. If you don't have one already, you can obtain it from your email client or create a sample PST file for testing purposes.
### 3. Set Up Development Environment
Make sure you have a suitable development environment set up for .NET programming. This includes having Visual Studio or any compatible IDE installed on your system.

## Import Namespaces
Now, let's import the necessary namespaces to kickstart the conversion process:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;
```

The System.IO namespace is essential for handling input/output operations such as file reading and writing.

Now that we've covered the prerequisites and imported the required namespaces, let's dive into the step-by-step process of converting PST to PDF:
## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pst-converted-{0}-to.pdf");
```
Specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved, along with the file name pattern. The "{0}" placeholder will be replaced with a counter to generate unique file names.
## Step 2: Load the Source PST File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_PST, fileType => fileType == EmailFileType.Pst
                                                                                                    ? new PersonalStorageLoadOptions()
                                                                                                    : null))
```
Initialize the GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter object with the path to the source PST file. Ensure to provide appropriate load options for PST files.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Create an instance of PdfConvertOptions to specify any additional settings for the PDF conversion, if required.
## Step 4: Perform Conversion
```csharp
var counter = 1;
converter.Convert(
    (FileType fileType) => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFile, counter++), FileMode.Create),
    options
);
```
Invoke the Convert method of the converter object, passing a delegate function to create a FileStream for each converted PDF file. The counter ensures unique file names.
## Step 5: Verify Conversion Completion
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Display a message confirming the successful completion of the conversion process and indicate the location of the converted PDF files.
