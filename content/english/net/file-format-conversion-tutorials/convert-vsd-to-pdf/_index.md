# Convert VSD to PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of .NET development, efficient document conversion is a critical task. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET emerges as a powerful tool for seamless conversion operations, offering developers the capability to effortlessly convert various file formats. Among these conversions, transforming Visio files (VSD) into Portable Document Format (PDF) stands as a common requirement. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the step-by-step process of converting VSD files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:
### .NET Environment
Make sure you have a functional .NET development environment installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version from [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
### GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Install the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET package into your project. You can obtain the package from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).

## Import Namespaces
Before proceeding with the conversion, import the necessary namespaces into your project. These namespaces will provide access to the functionalities required for document conversion.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
This line imports the GroupDocs.Conversion namespace, granting access to its classes and methods.

Now that we have set up the prerequisites and imported the necessary namespaces, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps:
## Step 1: Specify Output Folder and File
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vsd-converted-to.pdf");
```
Define the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure to specify the output file name along with the desired extension.
## Step 2: Load the Source VSD File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_VSD))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Create an instance of the Converter class by passing the path of the source VSD file as a parameter within a using block. This ensures proper disposal of resources after conversion.
## Step 3: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Instantiate PdfConvertOptions to specify any additional settings for the PDF conversion if needed. This step is optional, and default settings will be applied if omitted.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Execute the conversion process by invoking the Convert method on the Converter instance, passing the output file path and conversion options (if any).
## Step 5: Display Conversion Completion Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
Notify the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the location where the converted PDF file can be found.
