}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading an EPUB File with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

This section covers loading an EPUB file, a crucial feature for any eBook handling application.

#### Overview
Loading an EPUB file involves initializing the `Converter` class and specifying your document's path. This step prepares the conversion object for further operations like converting to different formats.

#### Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Define the Input File Path**

Start by setting up the directory where your EPUB file is stored:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\Sample.epub";
```

**Step 2: Initialize the Converter**

Use the `Converter` class to load your EPUB file. This class acts as a container for conversion operations.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Ready to perform conversions or other operations
}
```

- **Parameters**: The `Converter` constructor accepts a string representing the file path.
- **Return Values**: It returns an instance of the `Converter` class, which can be used for subsequent operations.

**Step 3: Handle Exceptions and Troubleshooting**

Consider common issues such as incorrect file paths or unsupported formats. Always ensure your EPUB files are valid:

```csharp
try
{
    using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("EPUB file loaded successfully.");
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```
