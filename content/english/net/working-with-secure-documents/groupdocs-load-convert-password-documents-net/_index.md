## Implementation Guide

Now that we have our environment ready, let's dive into the implementation steps for loading and converting a password-protected Word document.

### Loading Password-Protected Documents

#### Overview

The first step involves securely loading your password-protected Word documents. This section will guide you through setting up the necessary configurations to handle such files effectively.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Document Path**
   Set the path to your document by replacing `'YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY'` with the actual directory:

   ```csharp
   string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "protected_document.docx");
   ```

2. **Configure Load Options**
   Specify the password for loading the document:

   ```csharp
   var loadOptions = new WordProcessingLoadOptions
   {
       Password = "yourPassword"
   };
   ```

3. **Initialize Converter**
   Use the `Converter` class to handle the conversion process:

   ```csharp
   using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath, () => loadOptions))
   {
       // Conversion logic will be added here
   }
   ```

### Converting to PDF

#### Overview

After loading your document, you'll need to convert it into a desired format—in this case, PDF. This section details the conversion process.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Convert Options**
   Define how the file should be converted:

   ```csharp
   var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
   ```

2. **Execute Conversion**
   Perform the conversion and save the output:

   ```csharp
   string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "converted_document.pdf");

   converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
   ```

### Key Configuration Options
- **Password Handling**: Ensure you securely manage passwords in your application.
- **Output Settings**: Customize PDF settings like page range or watermarking as needed.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Document Not Loading**: Double-check the password and file path.
- **Conversion Errors**: Verify that all necessary DLLs are included in your project references.
