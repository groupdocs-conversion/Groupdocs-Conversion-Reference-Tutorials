### Convert EMF File to XLSX Format
#### Overview
This feature allows seamless transformation of graphic data from an EMF file into a structured Excel format, facilitating easy manipulation and analysis.
##### Step 1: Prepare Conversion Options
First, set up the conversion options specific to XLSX files:
```csharp
// Setup conversion options for XLSX format
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```
#### Step 2: Perform the Conversion
Next, execute the conversion using the `Convert` method:
```csharp
// Convert EMF file to XLSX
converter.Convert("output/path/file.xlsx", options);
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- **"output/path/file.xlsx":** The target path for your converted file.
