using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define input and output paths
string sampleJsonPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.json");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.xlsx");

// Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
}

// Initialize the Converter object with a sample JSON file
using (Converter converter = new Converter(sampleJsonPath))
{
    // Set up conversion options for converting to a spreadsheet format
    SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
    
    // Perform the conversion from JSON to Excel
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: JSON to Spreadsheet Conversion

This feature demonstrates how to convert a JSON document into an Excel spreadsheet using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Setting Up Directories and File Paths

Ensure your input and output directories are correctly set up:

```csharp
using System.IO;

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string sampleJsonPath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.json");
string convertedOutputPath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output", "converted.xlsx");

if (!Directory.Exists(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output")))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "output"));
}
```

#### Conversion Process
1. **Initialize Converter:** Load your JSON file into the `Converter` object.
2. **Set Options:** Use `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` to define conversion settings.
3. **Execute Conversion:** Call the `Convert` method to transform your JSON data into an Excel file.
