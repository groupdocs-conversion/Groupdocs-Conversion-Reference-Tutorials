    static void Main()
    {
        var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.cgm");
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert CGM to XLSX

This feature enables converting CGM files into the widely-used XLSX format, making it easier to manipulate and analyze graphics data.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

First, set up your input and output directories. Replace `YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY` and `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` with appropriate paths on your system.

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

// Paths for the source CGM file and target XLSX file
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.cgm");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "cgm-converted-to.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Load Source File

Load your source CGM file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options

Define the conversion options for XLSX format:

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 4: Execute Conversion

Perform the actual conversion from CGM to XLSX:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

This process will save your converted file in the specified output directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Path Issues:** Ensure correct paths for input and output files.
- **Library Compatibility:** Verify that you have the correct version of GroupDocs.Conversion installed.

## Practical Applications

Converting CGM to XLSX is useful in various real-world scenarios, such as:
1. **Data Analysis:** Easily analyze graphical data using Excel's powerful tools.
