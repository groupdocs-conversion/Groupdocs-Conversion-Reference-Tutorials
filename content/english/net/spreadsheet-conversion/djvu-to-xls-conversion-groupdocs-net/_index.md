// Initialize Converter
var converter = new Converter("sample.djvu");
```
This simple setup allows you to start working with document conversions.

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Load DJVU File
#### Overview
Loading a DJVU file is the first step in conversion. This section covers how to initialize and prepare your file for transformation using GroupDocs.Conversion.
##### Step 1: Define the Input Path
Specify where your DJVU file resides:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.djvu";
```
##### Step 2: Initialize Converter Instance
Create a new `Converter` instance with your DJVU file path:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Your file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
}
```
### Feature: Configure Conversion Options
#### Overview
Configuring the correct options ensures your document converts correctly into an XLS format.
##### Step 1: Create SpreadsheetConvertOptions
Set up the conversion options targeting XLS:

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
options.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls;
```
### Feature: Save Converted File
#### Overview
The final step is saving your converted file in your desired directory with a specified format.
##### Step 1: Define Output Directory and Path
Ensure the output directory exists, then define where to save the converted file:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "djvu-converted-to.xls");
```
##### Step 2: Perform Conversion and Save File
Using the previously set up `Converter` instance and conversion options, save your converted file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.djvu"))
{
    var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
    
    // Convert and save the output file.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
