    {
        // Initialize the Converter with an input file path
        string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.xls";
        
        using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");

## Implementation Guide

### Loading a Source XLS File

#### Overview
Loading your source Excel file is the first step in the conversion process. This section shows you how to use GroupDocs.Conversion to load an XLS file.

##### Step 1: Define Input Path and Load File
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.xls";

// Load the source XLS file
typing (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for conversion operations.
}
```

This snippet loads your Excel file into the `Converter` object, making it ready for further actions.

### Configuring Conversion Options for CSV

#### Overview
Configuring the correct options ensures that the conversion process outputs a properly formatted CSV file. Here’s how to set up these options using GroupDocs.Conversion.

##### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Create an instance of SpreadsheetConvertOptions and specify the format as CSV
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Csv };
```

The `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` class allows you to customize various conversion parameters, such as setting the output file type.

### Performing the Conversion from XLS to CSV

#### Overview
This section covers executing the actual conversion process and saving the resulting CSV file.

##### Step 3: Define Output Path and Perform Conversion
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xls-converted-to.csv");

// Perform the conversion from XLS to CSV
typing (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Execute the conversion and save the output file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

This code performs the conversion and writes the resulting CSV file to your specified directory.
