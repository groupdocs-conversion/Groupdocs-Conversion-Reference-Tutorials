var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions 
{
    Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls // Target format set to XLS
};
```

### Performing the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file.

#### Executing and Saving
With everything configured, convert and save your document:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "sxc-converted-to.xls");
