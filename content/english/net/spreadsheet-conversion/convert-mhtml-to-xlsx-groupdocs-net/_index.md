# How to Convert MHTML to XLSX Using GroupDocs.Conversion .NET: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

Ever wondered how you can effortlessly convert a web archive or email folder saved as an MHTML (.mhtml) file into a neat, editable Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)? Whether you're dealing with data extraction, reporting, or just cleaning up some information stored in a web archive, converting MHTML to XLSX can make your workflow more efficient.

Enter **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**—a robust, easy-to-use library that helps developers convert a variety of file formats quickly and reliably, right inside their applications. In this tutorial, I’ll guide you step-by-step through the process of converting an MHTML file into an XLSX spreadsheet with simple code snippets, clear explanations, and helpful tips.


## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, let's cover what you'll need:

- **.NET Development Environment**: Visual Studio or any compatible IDE supporting C#.
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**: You can download the library for free trial or purchase a license from their official site. Ensure you have the DLLs or install via NuGet.
- **An MHTML file** to test with: Make sure you have a sample `.mhtml` file ready.
- **Basic knowledge of C# and .NET Framework**: This tutorial assumes you are comfortable with some coding basics.


## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary namespace in your C# project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using System.IO;
```

These imports give your project access to the core conversion classes and options you'll configure.


## Step-by-Step Guide to Convert MHTML to XLSX

### Step 1: Set Up Your Output Directory and Files

Creating a dedicated output folder helps keep your converted files organized. Also, define the path to your source MHTML file.

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"C:\ConvertedFiles\"; // Change this to your desired output path
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-output.xlsx");
string sourceFilePath = @"C:\SourceFiles\sample.mhtml"; // Path to your source MHTML file
```

Tip: Ensure the output folder exists before proceeding. You can create it programmatically if needed.


### Step 2: Load Your Source MHTML File

Using `GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter` ensures your file loads correctly and is ready for conversion.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```

This block initializes the converter with your MHTML file.


### Step 3: Prepare Conversion Options

Since you're converting to Excel, use the `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` class. It offers several customization options if needed later, such as specifying sheet names, formatting, etc.

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```

You can explore additional settings if your project requires specific formatting.


### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Inside your `using` block, call the `Convert()` method, passing in the output file path and options.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
```

This call executes the conversion process seamlessly, transforming your MHTML into an Excel `.xlsx` file.


### Step 5: Confirm and Access Your Converted File

After the save completes, confirm success with a simple message, and know where to find your file.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Conversion successful! Check your file here: {outputFilePath}");
```

And that’s it! You're now able to automate MHTML to XLSX conversions in your applications with minimal fuss.


## Bonus Tips

- **Batch Conversion**: Loop through multiple files for bulk processing.
- **Progress Indicator**: Integrate progress callbacks for large files.
- **Customization**: Explore additional conversion options such as page ranges, formatting, and more.

Converting MHTML to XLSX with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is straightforward and highly customizable. Whether you’re processing email archives or web data, this approach puts you in control of transforming complex formats into user-friendly spreadsheets.
