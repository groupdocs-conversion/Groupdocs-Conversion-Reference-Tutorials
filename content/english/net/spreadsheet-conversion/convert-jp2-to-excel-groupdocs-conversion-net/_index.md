        }
    }
}
```
This snippet demonstrates how to load a JP2 file, which is our first step in the conversion process.

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Convert JP2 File to XLS Format
The primary functionality we'll cover is converting JPEG 2000 images (.jp2) into Excel files (.xls).

#### Step 1: Load the Source JP2 File
Begin by loading your source file using the `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("File loaded and ready for conversion.");
}
```
The `Converter` class handles the input file, preparing it for transformation.

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Next, set up your conversion options to specify the output format:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define Excel conversion options
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```
This configuration tells the converter that our desired output is an XLS file.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Now, letâ€™s execute the conversion:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jp2-converted-to.xls");

// Convert and save the output
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```
This snippet performs the actual file transformation and saves the result.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure your input path is correct.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and referenced in your project.
- Check for version compatibility between GroupDocs.Conversion and your .NET framework.
