## Implementation Guide

### Converting VSS to XLS

#### Overview
This section focuses on converting a VSS file into an Excel spreadsheet using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

**Step 1: Initialize the Conversion Handler**
Start by creating a new instance of the `Converter` class, passing your VSS file path as a parameter. This object handles all conversion operations.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your-file.vss"))
{
    // Additional code will go here
}
```

**Step 2: Set Conversion Options**
Next, specify the target format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`. Here you can adjust various settings like output file name and sheet options.

```csharp
var convertOptions = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
convertOptions.Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls;
```

**Step 3: Execute Conversion**
Now execute the conversion by calling the `Convert` method on your converter instance, passing in both the target path and the options object.

```csharp
converter.Convert("output-file-path.xls\
