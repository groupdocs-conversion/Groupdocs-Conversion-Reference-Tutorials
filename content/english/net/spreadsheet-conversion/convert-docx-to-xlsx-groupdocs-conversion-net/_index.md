namespace DocumentConversion
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Define paths for input DOCX file and output XLSX file
            string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.docx";
            string outputFile = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/docx-converted-to.xlsx";

            // Initialize the converter with the source DOCX file path
            using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert DOCX to XLSX

#### Overview
Converting Word documents into Excel spreadsheets is useful when processing text data in a tabular format. Follow these steps using GroupDocs.Conversion:

##### Step 1: Define File Paths and Initialize Converter
Specify paths for your input DOCX file and output XLSX file:
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docx");
string outputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "docx-converted-to.xlsx");
```
Initialize the `Converter` object with your source DOCX file path:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized successfully.");
}
```
##### Step 2: Create Conversion Options
Set up conversion options for XLSX format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:
```csharp
// Specify conversion options for the target XLSX file
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```
##### Step 3: Perform Conversion
Perform the conversion and save the output as an XLSX file:
```csharp
// Convert DOCX to XLSX and save it at the specified location
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);

Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```
### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue**: File not found errors. Ensure paths are correctly set and accessible.
- **Performance Lag**: Optimize file sizes before conversion to enhance performance.

## Practical Applications
Here are scenarios where converting DOCX files to XLSX is beneficial:
1. **Data Analysis**: Transform documents with structured data into Excel for easier analysis.
