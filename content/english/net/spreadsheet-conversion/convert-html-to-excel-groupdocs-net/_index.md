```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview of HTML to Excel Conversion
This feature allows you to transform an HTML document into a structured Excel spreadsheet, simplifying data extraction and manipulation.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory Paths
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "Output");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder); // Ensure the directory exists

// Convert and save with dynamic paths for flexibility and security
string outputPath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
- **SpreadsheetConvertOptions:** Customize options like page count or specific pages.
  
```csharp
var convertOptions = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions()
{
    PagesCount = 1 // Convert only the first page if needed
};
```

#### Step 3: Execute the Conversion Process
Use `Converter.Convert` to perform the conversion and handle any exceptions.

```csharp
try
{
    converter.Convert(outputPath, convertOptions);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
