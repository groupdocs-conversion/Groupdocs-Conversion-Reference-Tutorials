### Convert DJVU to XLSX

#### Overview
This section covers converting a DJVU file into an Excel spreadsheet, ideal for data extraction and analysis.

#### Step 1: Define Paths
Set up your source and output paths:
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.djvu");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "djvu-converted-to.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Load the DJVU File
Load your DJVU file using GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```
*Why?* Loading files is essential for processing them with GroupDocs APIs.

#### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Specify the target format and options:
