Let's dive right in, but first, let’s cover the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin our conversion journey, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** (Version 25.3.0 or later)
- Basic understanding of C# programming

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment capable of running .NET applications, such as Visual Studio.
- Access to a file system where you can store your input and output files.

With these prerequisites in place, let's set up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To get started with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, you need to install the library. Here’s how you can do it using different package managers:

### NuGet Package Manager Console
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

After installation, consider how you might acquire a license:
- **Free Trial:** Start with a trial to explore the features.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain one if you need extended access without purchasing immediately.
- **Purchase:** If satisfied, purchase a full license for production use.

Here's how you can initialize and set up GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# application:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Basic initialization of the library
var converter = new Converter("sample.dotx");
```

This simple setup is all it takes to start using the powerful conversion capabilities of GroupDocs.

## Implementation Guide

Now that you've set up your environment, let's break down the process into manageable steps.

### Convert DOTX to XLS with GroupDocs.Conversion

#### Overview
Converting .dotx files to .xls format involves loading the template and specifying conversion options. This section will guide you through each step of the process.

##### Step 1: Define File Paths
First, specify the paths for your input and output files:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.dotx");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dotx-converted-to.xls");
```

##### Step 2: Load the Source DOTX File
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your .dotx file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

This setup ensures that the file is correctly loaded and ready for conversion.

##### Step 3: Set Conversion Options
Specify options tailored for Excel format conversions:

```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```
Here, `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` allows you to define specific settings like the target format (`Xls` in this case).

##### Step 4: Execute Conversion and Save Output
Finally, perform the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

This line executes the transformation from .dotx to .xls, producing an Excel-compatible document.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that paths are correctly defined; incorrect paths can lead to file not found errors.
- Check for any version-specific issues by reviewing GroupDocs documentation if you encounter unexpected behavior.
