### Define Output Directory Path

#### Overview:
Before converting files, you need to determine where the output will be stored. The following function calculates and ensures the existence of the desired directory path.

#### Steps:

##### Set Up Conversion Paths and Load the Source File
Here's how you define your output directory dynamically using placeholders:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define the path for input and output files using placeholders
string inputWebpFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.webp");
string outputFolder = DirectoryManager.GetOutputDirectoryPath();
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "webp-converted-to.xlsx");

using (var converter = new Converter(inputWebpFilePath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Loaded the WEBP file for conversion.");
}
```

##### Specify Conversion Options
```csharp
// Specify conversion options for converting to XLSX format
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```

##### Perform the Conversion and Save Result
```csharp
// Convert and save the result as an XLSX file
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```
