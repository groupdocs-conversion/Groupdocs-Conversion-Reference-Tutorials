Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting out, I’ll keep things simple, engaging, and explained clearly. Ready? Let’s dive in!


## Prerequisites for ICO to XLS Conversion

Before jumping into coding, there are a few things you’ll need to get started with GroupDocs.Conversion in your project. Think of this as preparing all your ingredients before cooking.

### 1. Set Up Your .NET Development Environment

Ensure you have Visual Studio (2019 or later) installed on your system. This is your IDE where you’ll write and test your code.

### 2. Obtain a GroupDocs.Conversion License

While a free trial can get you started, for ongoing projects, it's better to purchase a license to unlock all features and remove limitations. Sign up & acquire a license from the [official site](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### 3. Download GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

You can install GroupDocs.Conversion via NuGet Package Manager. This gives you access to all the classes and methods you need. 

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion
```
Alternatively, download the DLL directly from [releases page](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).


## Import Packages

Once your environment is ready, you must import the necessary namespaces into your project.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
using System.IO;
```

These packages provide the classes and methods essential for file conversion and file handling.


## Step-by-Step Guide: Converting ICO to XLS with GroupDocs.Conversion

Now, let’s get into the core of the tutorial. We’ll break down the entire process into digestible steps.

### Step 1: Specify Your Input and Output Paths

First, define where your ICO file is located and where your XLS should be saved. This clarifies your source and destination.

```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"Path\To\Your\Icon.ico";
string outputFolder = @"Path\To\Output\Directory";
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-file.xls");
```

Consider creating an output directory beforehand to keep things organized.

### Step 2: Load the ICO File with GroupDocs Converter

Next, instantiate the Converter object with your ICO file. Think of this as opening the file for processing.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion options will go here
}
```

### Step 3: Choose the Conversion Format

Set up your conversion options specifically for XLS format. Use the `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` class to specify your desired output.

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls 
};
```

This step is akin to choosing the recipe for your conversion — what format do you want the output to be?

### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

With everything configured, execute the conversion process inside the `using` block.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
```

It’s like pressing the “Start” button on your machine. GroupDocs handles the heavy lifting here.

### Step 5: Confirm Successful Conversion

Finally, add a simple message to notify you that the process has completed smoothly.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Conversion completed! Check your output at {outputFolder}");
```
