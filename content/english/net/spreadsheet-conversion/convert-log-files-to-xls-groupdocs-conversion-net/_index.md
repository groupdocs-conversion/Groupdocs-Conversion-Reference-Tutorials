using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Define paths for input and output files
        string inputFile = "path/to/your/sample.log";
        string outputFile = "path/to/output/log-converted-to.xls";

        // Initialize the Converter object with the source file path
        using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
        {
            // Conversion is ready to be performed
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Load the Source LOG File

Start by loading your LOG file. This step initializes the conversion process:

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Initialize Converter

```csharp
string inputFile = "path/to/your/sample.log";
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion setup is complete
}
```

### Set Conversion Options for XLS Format

Next, configure the conversion options to specify that you want an XLS output:
