## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Load a JPX File
**Overview**
Loading a .jpx file is the first step in preparing it for conversion. This feature allows you to integrate image data seamlessly into your application's workflow.

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Document Directory
Ensure that your document directory path is correctly set where your JPX files are stored.
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source File
Create an instance of the `Converter` class and open the source JPX file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.jpx")))
{
    // The file is now loaded and ready for conversion
}
```

### Feature: Convert JPX to XLS Format
**Overview**
Converting a .jpx file to .xls format allows you to utilize image data within spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel.

#### Step 1: Set Output Paths
Define paths for your output directory and the name of the converted file:
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "jpx-converted-to.xls");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Conversion Options
Specify that you want to convert the image file into an XLS format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:
```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file in your desired location:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** File not found. Ensure the path to your source JPX file is correct.
