## Implementation Guide

### Convert POTM to XLS

This feature converts POTM files into Excel spreadsheets (XLS) for easier data manipulation.

#### Step 1: Load the Source POTM File

Load your POTM document using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.potm";
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Set up conversion options to specify the target format (XLS):

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls
};
```

#### Step 3: Execute the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save your XLS file:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "potm-converted-to.xls");

using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Verify the POTM file path is correct.
- Ensure your output directory exists and is writable.
