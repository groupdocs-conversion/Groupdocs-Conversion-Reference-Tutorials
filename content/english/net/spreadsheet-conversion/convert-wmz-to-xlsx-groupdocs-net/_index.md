        {
            // Define the path for your document
            string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.wmz";

            // Initialize Converter object with the WMZ file path
            using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("WMZ file loaded successfully.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Let's break down the conversion process into logical steps.

### Load a WMZ File
**Overview**: The first step is to load your WMZ file using GroupDocs.Conversion. This sets up the environment for further operations.

#### Step 1: Specify Document Path
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.wmz");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter Object
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // The WMZ file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
}
```

### Configure Conversion Options
**Overview**: Define how the WMZ file should be converted to XLSX, including specific settings.

#### Step 1: Create SpreadsheetConvertOptions Instance
```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
// Customize options if needed (e.g., page numbers)
```

### Perform the Conversion
**Overview**: Execute the conversion from WMZ to XLSX and save the output file.

#### Step 1: Define Output Path
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "wmz-converted-to.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Convert and Save File
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
    // Convert and save the XLSX file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
