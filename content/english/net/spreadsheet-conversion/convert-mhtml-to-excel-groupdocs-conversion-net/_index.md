## Implementation Guide

### Loading and Converting MHTML to XLS

#### Overview
This section guides you through loading an MHTML file and converting it into the XLS format, preparing your document data for spreadsheet analysis.

##### Step 1: Define File Paths
Specify directory paths for your input MHTML file and output XLS file. Ensure the output directory exists:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mhtml");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mhtml-converted-to.xls");
```

##### Step 2: Load the MHTML File
Create a `Converter` instance to load your source file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("MHTML file loaded successfully.");
}
```

##### Step 3: Specify Conversion Options
Define conversion options for the XLS format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:

```csharp
// Set up conversion options for XLS format.
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

##### Step 4: Perform Conversion and Save Output
Execute the conversion by calling the `Convert` method, saving your file in the specified output directory:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion to XLS completed successfully.");
```

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Common Issue:** File not found errors can occur if the source path is incorrect. Double-check your file paths.
