## Implementation Guide

### Convert HTML to XLS

This feature lets you transform an HTML file into a well-structured Excel spreadsheet, ideal for data analysis and reporting.

#### Step 1: Load the Source HTML File

Start by loading your source HTML document using the `Converter` class. Ensure that the path to your HTML file is correctly specified:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.html");
```

#### Step 2: Specify Conversion Options

Define conversion options for the XLS format, which tells GroupDocs.Conversion how you want your output file formatted:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
}
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion process and save the resulting Excel file to your specified directory:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "html-converted-to.xls");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
