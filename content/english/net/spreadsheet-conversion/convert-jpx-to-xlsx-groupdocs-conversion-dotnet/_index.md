        string outputFolder = "output_directory"; // Define the output directory path.
        string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jpx-converted-to.xlsx"); // Resulting XLSX file location.

        using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
        {
            var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions(); // Initialize conversion options for spreadsheets.
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Convert and save the JPX file as XLSX.
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview of Conversion Process

Converting a JPX file to an XLSX involves loading the source file, specifying conversion options, and executing the conversion process.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Loading the Source File**
The first step is to load your JPX file using the `Converter` class provided by GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```

**2. Setting Conversion Options**
Next, specify the conversion options for exporting to an Excel format:
```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```
This object allows you to configure various settings such as page numbers and zoom level.

**3. Executing the Conversion**
Finally, execute the conversion process using the `Convert` method:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Key Configuration Options
- **Page Range:** Control which pages of a multi-page image are converted.
- **Zoom Level:** Adjust the output's zoom level to suit your needs.

### Troubleshooting Tips
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure the JPX file path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check for any exceptions thrown during execution, which can provide clues about what might be wrong.

## Practical Applications
1. **Data Archiving:** Convert large image files into Excel spreadsheets to document metadata in a tabular format.
2. **Reporting Systems:** Integrate JPX to XLSX conversions within reporting systems for easy data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Cross-platform Data Sharing:** Facilitate sharing of visual data across platforms that support spreadsheet formats.

## Performance Considerations
### Optimizing Conversion Speed
- Use efficient file paths and ensure your system has adequate resources (RAM, CPU).
- Convert files in batches to manage resource usage effectively.

### Memory Management Best Practices
- Dispose of any `IDisposable` objects properly using the `using` statement.
- Monitor application performance to detect memory leaks early.
