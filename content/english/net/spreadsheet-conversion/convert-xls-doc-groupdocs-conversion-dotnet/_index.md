## Prerequisites

Before implementing the conversion, ensure you have the following requirements met:
- **Required Libraries and Versions**: You'll need GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET version 25.3.0.
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure your development environment supports .NET applications.
- **Knowledge**: A basic understanding of C# programming is necessary.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To get started with GroupDocs.Conversion, you need to install the library in your project. You can do this using NuGet Package Manager or via .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

To initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your project, start by importing the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's walk through the process of converting an XLS file to DOC format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Define File Paths

First, specify the directories and file paths:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Input directory
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Output directory

// Paths to your source XLS file and resulting DOC file
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.xls");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xls-converted-to.doc");
```

### Load the XLS Document

Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load the XLS file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

### Set Up Conversion Options

Configure conversion options for DOC format:

```csharp
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions
{
    Format = WordProcessingFileType.Doc
};
```

### Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue**: Ensure the source directory contains the XLS file.
- **Solution**: Verify file paths and permissions.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be used in various scenarios such as:
