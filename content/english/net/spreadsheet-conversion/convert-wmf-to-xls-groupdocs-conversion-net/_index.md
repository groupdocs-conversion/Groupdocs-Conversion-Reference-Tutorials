## Implementation Guide

### Convert WMF to XLS

This feature allows you to convert Windows Metafiles into Excel files, preserving the layout and design.

#### Step 1: Define Paths for Input and Output Files

Start by defining the directory paths for your source WMF file and the output XLS file:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Path to input WMF file
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";     // Path for converted XLS file

// Define full path for input and output files
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.wmf");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "wmf-converted-to.xls");
```

#### Step 2: Load the WMF File

Load your source WMF file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile)) 
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options for XLS Format

Set up conversion options to specify the target format as XLS:

```csharp
// Configure conversion options for XLS format
types = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion and Save Output

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
// Convert and save the WMF as an XLS file
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
