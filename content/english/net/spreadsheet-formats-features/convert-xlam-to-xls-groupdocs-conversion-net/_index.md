We'll break down the conversion process into easy-to-follow steps.

### XLAM to XLS Conversion

#### Overview

This feature converts an Excel Add-In file (XLAM) to a standard Excel workbook (XLS), ensuring compatibility with various Microsoft Office versions.

#### Step 1: Set Up File Paths

Configure your document and output directories using placeholders:

```csharp
string sourcePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "source.xlam");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "xlam-converted-to.xls");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source XLAM File

Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your XLAM file, specifying the path:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourcePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will follow here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Define Conversion Options

Specify conversion settings for XLS format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:

```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

This configuration ensures the output file is in the desired XLS format.

#### Step 4: Convert and Save Output

Execute the conversion and save the resultant XLS file:

```csharp
csv converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
```

### File Path Configuration

#### Overview

Setting up your file paths correctly is crucial for successful conversions. This feature ensures you have properly defined input and output directories.

#### Step 1: Define Directories

Establish the directory structure for source and target files:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Combine Paths

Generate full file paths using `Path.Combine`:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "source.xlam");
string targetFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlam-converted-to.xls");
```

## Practical Applications

1. **Business Data Analysis:** Convert legacy add-ins for use in modern analytics tools.
