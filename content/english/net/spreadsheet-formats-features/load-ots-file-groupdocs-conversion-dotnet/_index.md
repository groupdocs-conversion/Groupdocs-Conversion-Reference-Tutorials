## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into clear, manageable sections.

### Load and Convert an OTS File Using GroupDocs.Conversion
This feature allows you to load and convert an OTS file, crucial for any subsequent operations. Hereâ€™s how:

#### Step 1: Define the Source File Path
Set the path where your OTS document resides. Ensure that this path is correct and accessible by your application.

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.ots";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize GroupDocs.Conversion
Create an instance of the `Converter` class, passing in the file path as a parameter. This step loads the document into memory for conversion operations.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Additional operations can be performed here
}
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion Operations
Within the using block, you can now perform various conversions or manipulations on your loaded OTS file.
