## Implementation Guide

### Converting XLSM to XLS

#### Overview

This feature allows you to convert an XLSM file into the simpler XLS format, making it compatible with systems that do not support macros.

##### Step 1: Load Your Source File

First, ensure your XLSM file is accessible in your project directory. Then load it using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("sample.xlsm"))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here.
}
```

##### Step 2: Define Conversion Options

Specify the conversion options for transforming an XLSM file to XLS format.

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

Here, `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` lets you specify the target format, and `SpreadsheetFileType.Xls` sets it to Excel's older binary format (XLS).

##### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Finally, execute the conversion process and save your file.

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlsm-converted-to.xls");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

This code saves the converted file to your specified directory. Ensure `outputFolder` is correctly set to avoid path errors.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **Common Issue:** File not found error.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your file paths and ensure the XLSM file exists in the expected location.

## Practical Applications

1. **Business Reporting:** Convert macro-enabled reports to a compatible format for broader distribution.
2. **Data Archiving:** Archive sensitive data by converting files into formats with restricted editing capabilities.
3. **Integration with Legacy Systems:** Facilitate compatibility between modern spreadsheets and older systems that only support XLS.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Ensure your application manages memory effectively, especially when handling large files.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Dispose of resources properly using `using` statements to prevent memory leaks.
  - Use asynchronous methods if available for non-blocking operations.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to leverage GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert XLSM files into the XLS format. This powerful tool simplifies file conversion tasks and ensures compatibility across different systems.
