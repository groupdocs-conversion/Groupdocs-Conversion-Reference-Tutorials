- **GroupDocs.Conversion Library**: Ensure version 25.3.0 is installed.
- **Development Environment**: Your environment should support .NET Core or Framework.
- **Basic C# Knowledge**: Familiarity with C# programming concepts will be helpful.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start converting your spreadsheets, you need to install the GroupDocs.Conversion library. Here's how you can add it to your project:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

#### Basic Initialization

Here's how to set up and initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

// Initialize converter with an input document path.
using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your/document.xlsx"))
{
    // Your conversion code will go here.
}
```

This setup prepares you for loading and converting documents. Now, let's move on to the main features.

## Implementation Guide

### Load Spreadsheet with Hidden Sheets

**Overview**: This feature demonstrates how to load spreadsheets, ensuring that hidden sheets are included during the conversion process.

#### Step 1: Define Load Options

Start by creating a function to define your load options:

```csharp
Func<LoadContext, LoadOptions> getLoadOptions = loadContext => new SpreadsheetLoadOptions
{
    ShowHiddenSheets = true,
    OnePagePerSheet = true
};
```

- **ShowHiddenSheets**: Ensures hidden sheets are processed.
- **OnePagePerSheet**: Each sheet is converted to a single PDF page.

### Convert Spreadsheet to PDF with Advanced Options

**Overview**: This section covers converting your loaded spreadsheet into a PDF file while applying specific conversion settings for optimized output.

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Parameters

Specify the desired output location and initialize the converter:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pdf");

// Initialize Converter with load options.
using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your/document.xlsx", getLoadOptions))
{
    // Define conversion settings for PDF.
    var convertOptions = new PdfConvertOptions();

    // Perform the conversion.
    converter.Convert(() => File.Create(outputFile), convertOptions);
}
```

- **Output Directory**: Ensure your output path is valid and writable.
- **PdfConvertOptions**: Customize these to tweak the PDF's appearance.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure hidden sheets are present in your document by checking it manually before conversion.
- Validate file paths for both input and output directories to avoid runtime errors.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion can be integrated into various .NET applications, such as:
1. **Automated Report Generation**: Convert financial or statistical reports stored in Excel files directly into shareable PDFs.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Use within software that manages large volumes of documents requiring format standardization.
3. **Data Archiving Solutions**: Preserve data integrity by converting spreadsheets to a non-editable format like PDF.

## Performance Considerations

- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU and memory usage, especially when processing large files.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements for efficient resource management.
- **Batch Processing**: For multiple file conversions, consider parallelizing tasks while keeping system limits in mind.

## Conclusion
