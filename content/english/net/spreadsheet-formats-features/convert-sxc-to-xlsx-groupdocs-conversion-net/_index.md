        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialized successfully!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Loading and Converting an SXC File to XLSX

This feature allows you to load an existing SXC file and convert it into the more widely used XLSX format.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path

Start by setting up your output directory:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "ConvertedFiles");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "sxc-converted-to.xlsx");

// Ensure the output directory exists
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
```

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the SXC File

Next, load your SXC file and initialize conversion options:

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.sxc"))
{
    var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
    // Perform the conversion
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter`: Loads the SXC file from your specified path.
- `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`: Sets the conversion target format to XLSX.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues:
- Ensure the source SXC file exists at the given path.
- Verify that all necessary permissions are set for reading and writing files in your application directory.

## Practical Applications

1. **Data Migration:** Convert legacy data stored in SXC format to XLSX for modern business analytics tools.
2. **Integration with Reporting Tools:** Use converted XLSX files as input for generating reports using .NET-based reporting frameworks like Telerik or DevExpress.
3. **Automated Workflows:** Integrate file conversion into automated data processing pipelines within .NET applications.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance:
- Limit the number of simultaneous conversions to prevent excessive memory usage.
- Use asynchronous methods if supported, allowing your application to handle other tasks while converting files.

**Best Practices:**
- Regularly update GroupDocs.Conversion to leverage performance improvements and bug fixes.
- Monitor resource utilization during conversion processes for potential bottlenecks.
