            string inputDocumentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.xlsm";
            // Initialize the converter with your license if available
            using (var converter = new Converter(inputDocumentPath))
            {
                // Your conversion logic will go here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview of XLSM to CSV Conversion

This feature allows you to transform an Excel Macro-Enabled Spreadsheet into a CSV format, which can be easily processed or transferred between systems.

#### Step 1: Define Document Paths

Set up your input and output directories:

```csharp
string inputDocumentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.xlsm");
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "xlsm-converted-to.csv");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source XLSM File

Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your XLSM file:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputDocumentPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be implemented here
}
```

#### Step 3: Specify CSV Conversion Options

Configure conversion settings for the CSV format:

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions
{
    Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Csv // Set target format to CSV
};
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
