## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Load OTP File

#### Overview
Loading an Origin Graph Template file is the first step in our conversion process using GroupDocs.Conversion. This feature ensures your .otp data is ready for transformation into Excel format.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Define the Document Directory**
```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string filePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.otp");
```
Here, `documentDirectory` should point to where your OTP files are stored.

**2. Initialize Converter Object**
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(filePath)) {
    // Your conversion logic will go here.
}
```
The `Converter` object takes the file path of your OTP file and prepares it for further operations like conversion.

### Feature: Convert OTP to XLS

#### Overview
Once loaded, you can convert the OTP file into an Excel spreadsheet (.xls format) using specific conversion options provided by GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Set Output Directory**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "otp-converted-to.xls");
```
Ensure `outputDirectory` is a valid path where the converted file will be saved.

**2. Load Source OTP File and Specify Conversion Options**
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.otp")) {
    SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
    
    // Perform the conversion
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`: Configures how your file will be converted to Excel.
- `Format`: Specifies the target format (XLS in this case).

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly set and accessible.
- Validate that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and licensed.

## Practical Applications
