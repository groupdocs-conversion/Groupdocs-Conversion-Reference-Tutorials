}
```

This sets up the foundation for converting files using the library.

## Implementation Guide

### Convert CSV to Another CSV Format

#### Overview
The primary functionality of this feature is to convert a source CSV file into another CSV format, potentially with different configurations or structures.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual directory path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "csv-converted-to.csv");
```

**Explanation:** Specify where the converted file will be saved by setting the output directory and filename.

#### Step 2: Load the Source CSV File

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.csv"))
{
    // Further conversion steps follow
}
```

**Explanation:** Load your source CSV file into the `Converter` object. Ensure the path to your file is correct.

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions
{
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Csv
};
```

**Explanation:** Set up the conversion options, specifying that the output should remain in CSV format but can be customized as needed.

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Explanation:** Execute the conversion and save the result to your specified output path. This step finalizes the transformation process.

### Troubleshooting Tips
