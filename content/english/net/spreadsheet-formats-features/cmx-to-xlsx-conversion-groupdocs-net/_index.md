```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the process of converting a CMX file to XLSX format.

### Loading and Converting a CMX File
**Overview**: This feature allows you to load a CMX document and convert it into an Excel-compatible XLSX file using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Specify Paths and Load the Source CMX File
First, define your source and output directories. Then, initialize the `Converter` class with the path of your CMX file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
// Define document paths
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.cmx"); // Replace 'sample.cmx' with your actual CMX filename

// Load the CMX file
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    Console.WriteLine("CMX file loaded successfully.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Specify Conversion Options for XLSX Format
Next, set up the conversion options to specify that you want to convert your document to an XLSX format:

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
Console.WriteLine("Conversion options set to XLSX.");
```

#### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output File
Finally, execute the conversion and save the output file in the designated directory:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "cmx-converted-to.xlsx");

// Perform conversion
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed. Check the output directory.");
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure your CMX files are not corrupted.
- Verify file paths and permissions for both source and destination directories.
