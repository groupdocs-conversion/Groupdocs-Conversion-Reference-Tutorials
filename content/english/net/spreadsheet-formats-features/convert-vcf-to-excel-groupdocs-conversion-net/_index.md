        // Load the VCF file using GroupDocs.Conversion
        var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.vcf"));
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load Source VCF File

**Overview:** This feature demonstrates how to load a VCF file ready for conversion.

#### Step 1: Specify Document Directory

Set the path where your source VCF file is located:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Create Full Path and Load File

Create the full path for the VCF file and load it using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Create the full path to the sample VCF file
string vcfFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.vcf");

// Initialize the converter object with your source file
using (var converter = new Converter(vcfFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for conversion operations.
}
```

### Feature 2: Convert VCF to XLS Format

**Overview:** This section covers converting a loaded VCF file into an Excel spreadsheet.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and File Path

Determine where the converted file will be saved:

```csharp
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "vcf-converted-to.xls");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Conversion Options

Set up options for converting to XLS format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define the conversion options for Excel (XLS) format
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Convert and save the VCF as an XLS file using specified options
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

**Troubleshooting Tip:** Ensure that paths for both source and output directories are correctly set to avoid file not found errors.
