using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

        // Initialize the converter with an input file path.
        using (Converter converter = new Converter(@"path\\to\\your\\file.xlam"))
        {
            var options = new MarkupConvertOptions { Format = MarkupFileType.Tex };

            // Convert and save the output as a .tex document
            converter.Convert(() => File.Create(Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.tex")), options);
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through converting XLAM files to TEX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Overview of the Conversion Process

The conversion process involves loading your .xlam file and setting up the necessary conversion options to output a .tex document. Let's break this down step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory Path

Ensure you have an output directory path defined, which will store your converted TEX files:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
```

#### Step 2: Load the XLAM File

Using the `Converter` class, load your .xlam file. This class provides methods to convert documents between different formats.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(@"path\\to\\your\\file.xlam"))
{
    // Conversion logic will follow here.
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

Set up the conversion options specifying that you want to convert to TEX format using `MarkupConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new MarkupConvertOptions { Format = MarkupFileType.Tex };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
converter.Convert(() => File.Create(Path.Combine(outputFolder, "output.tex")), options);
```

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Ensure your XLAM files are not corrupted or locked by another application.
- Verify that the output directory path is correctly set and accessible.
