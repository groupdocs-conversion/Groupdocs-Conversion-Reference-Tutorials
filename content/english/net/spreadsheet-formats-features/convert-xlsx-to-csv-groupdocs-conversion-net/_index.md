# How to Convert XLSX Files to CSV Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Do you need a reliable method to convert Excel files (XLSX) into the widely compatible CSV format? This tutorial will guide you through using **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** to seamlessly transform your data. Converting XLSX to CSV is essential when dealing with systems that only accept CSV files.

### What You’ll Learn:
- Loading XLSX files with GroupDocs.Conversion
- Converting XLSX to CSV in C#
- Setting up your .NET environment for file conversions

Before we begin, let's cover the prerequisites!

## Prerequisites (H2)

Ensure you have the following before starting:

- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET** installed. This library is crucial for facilitating the conversion process.
- A basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with the .NET framework environment.
- Visual Studio or a similar IDE set up on your machine to write and execute C# code.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (H2)

### Installation

To get started, you’ll need to install GroupDocs.Conversion. You can do this using either the NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI.

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial, temporary licenses for extended testing, and options to purchase. Visit their [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) for more details.

### Basic Initialization

Here's how you can initialize the GroupDocs.Conversion library in your C# project:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize Converter with an XLSX file
string inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx";
using (var converter = new Converter(inputDocumentPath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for further operations like conversion.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load XLSX File

**Overview:** This section demonstrates how to load an XLSX file using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Loading the File
Here's how you can load your XLSX document:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    internal static class LoadXlsxExample
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            string inputDocumentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx";
            
            using (var converter = new Converter(inputDocumentPath))
            {
                // The file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** This code initializes the `Converter` class with your XLSX file path, making it ready for subsequent operations.

### Convert XLSX to CSV

**Overview:** Now that you've loaded your XLSX file, let’s convert it into a CSV format.

#### Setting Up Conversion Options
Firstly, specify the conversion options for CSV:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    internal static class ConvertXlsxToCsvExample
    {
        public static void Run()
        {
            string outputFolder = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
            Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);

            string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xlsx-converted-to.csv");

            using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.xlsx"))
            {
                SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Csv };
                
                // Convert and save the XLSX file as a CSV
                converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** In this code, we specify `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` for converting to CSV format. The converted file is then saved in the designated output directory.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your input XLSX file path and output directories are correctly specified.
- Verify that you have write permissions to the specified output folder.
