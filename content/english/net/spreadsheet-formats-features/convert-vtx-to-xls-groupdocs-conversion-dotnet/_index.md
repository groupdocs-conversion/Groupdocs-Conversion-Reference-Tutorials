## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert VTX to XLS

This feature enables conversion of Visio files into Excel spreadsheets for enhanced data usability.

#### Overview of the Conversion Process
Understanding how GroupDocs.Conversion processes your files is crucial. The library efficiently handles file reading and conversion, offering customization through `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Initialize Converter:** Load the VTX file using the `Converter` class.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter("input.vtx"))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here.
}
```

**2. Set Convert Options:** Define conversion settings with `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```

**3. Perform Conversion:** Use the `Convert` method to create the XLS file.

```csharp
converter.Convert("output.xls", options);
```

#### Explanation of Parameters and Methods
- **Converter(string filePath):** Initializes with your source VTX file path.
- **SpreadsheetConvertOptions():** Configures conversion settings, such as format and page ranges.
- **Convert(string outputPath, ConvertOptions options):** Executes the conversion process.

### Troubleshooting Tips
