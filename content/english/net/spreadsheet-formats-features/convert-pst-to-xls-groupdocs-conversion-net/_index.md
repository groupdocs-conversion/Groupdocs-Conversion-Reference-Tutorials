```

## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the implementation into sections based on features, guiding you through converting PST files to XLS.

### Convert PST to XLS

This feature converts a Personal Storage Table (.pst) file into an Excel Spreadsheet (.xls).

#### Overview
The process involves initializing the converter with your source PST file and configuring it for output in XLS format.

**Implementation Steps:**

##### Step 1: Initialize Converter
Set up the converter using the path to your PST file:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pst");
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Further configuration steps will follow.
}
```

##### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Define conversion options to specify the output format as XLS:

```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

##### Step 3: Perform Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the result:

```csharp
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "pst-converted-{0}-to.xls");
converter.Convert(
    (SaveContext saveContext) => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, counter++), FileMode.Create),
    options
);
```

**Explanation:**
- **Load Context:** Determines special handling for OST files.
- **Conversion Options:** Specifies the target format as XLS.

### Load and Configure Conversion Options

This feature allows configuration of load settings based on file type and conditions.

#### Overview
Loading a PST file with specific conditions ensures accurate conversion, especially when dealing with different email formats like PST or OST.

**Implementation Steps:**

##### Step 1: Define Load Options
Set up options to handle different source formats:

```csharp
var loadOptions = new PersonalStorageLoadOptions();
```

##### Step 2: Determine File Type
Check if the file is an OST and apply specific configurations:

```csharp
bool isOstFile = (sourceFilePath.EndsWith(".ost", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));
if (isOstFile)
{
    // Additional handling for OST files.
}
```

### Define Conversion Options

This feature focuses on setting up conversion options to ensure the output file meets your requirements.

#### Overview
Configuring conversion options allows you to define how data should be formatted and stored in the XLS file.

**Implementation Steps:**

##### Step 1: Set Output Format
Specify that the target format is XLS:

```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```
