- Implementing the conversion with clear steps and code examples

Ready to streamline data transformation? Let’s begin by covering the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:
- **Libraries**: Download and install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (version 25.3.0 recommended).
- **Environment Setup**: A configured .NET development environment (Visual Studio is recommended).
- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of C# programming and file I/O operations.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

### Installation

Install GroupDocs.Conversion using either the NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**

```plaintext
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition

To start, obtain a free trial or temporary license to explore GroupDocs.Conversion's features. Visit [GroupDocs Purchase](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) for options and [Temporary License](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) if necessary.

### Initialization

Initialize the converter with your source file:

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
// Initialize the Converter object with your source TSV file.
var converter = new Converter("sample.tsv");
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process into clear steps.

### Load and Prepare Your TSV File

Specify paths for input and output files. Ensure a valid TSV file is ready:

```csharp
string dataDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine(dataDirectory, "sample.tsv");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "tsv-converted-to.xls");
```

### Convert TSV to XLS

Set up your conversion options for the target format:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Define conversion settings for Excel.
    var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };

    // Execute the conversion process.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

In this code:
- `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` specifies the format and any additional parameters.
- The `Format` property is set to `Xls`, indicating the desired output format.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

Common issues include incorrect file paths or missing dependencies. Ensure your directories exist, and all packages are properly installed.
