# How to Convert RTF to XLS Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

Converting Rich Text Format (RTF) documents into Excel spreadsheets can streamline data processing tasks. This comprehensive guide will walk you through using the **GroupDocs.Conversion library** in a .NET environment, making your conversion process efficient and straightforward.

### What You'll Learn:
- Setting up GroupDocs.Conversion in your .NET project
- Step-by-step RTF to XLS conversion
- Key configuration options and performance tips

By following this guide, you'll be equipped to handle document conversions with ease. Let's explore the prerequisites needed before we begin.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your development environment is ready for integrating GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET:

### Required Libraries and Versions
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**: Version 25.3.0 or later.
- .NET Framework (preferably 4.6.1 or higher) or .NET Core/5+.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- Visual Studio with .NET capabilities installed.
- Basic understanding of C# and file I/O operations in .NET.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
Familiarity with handling files and directories in C#, as well as basic programming concepts, will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To use GroupDocs.Conversion, you need to install it into your project. Here's how:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**\.NET CLI**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

GroupDocs offers a free trial to test their API's capabilities before purchasing. To obtain a temporary license or explore purchase options, visit:
- **Free Trial**: [https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/)
- **Temporary License**: [https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/)
- **Purchase Options**: [https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy)

Once the package is installed and your license set up, initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Initialize the converter with a sample RTF file path
        string sourceRtfPath = "sample.rtf";
        using (var converter = new Converter(sourceRtfPath))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Conversion setup complete.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this snippet, we initialize GroupDocs.Conversion by loading an RTF document. This prepares us for the conversion process.
