**Basic Initialization and Setup in C#:**
Initialize your project for file conversion by setting up the `Converter` class:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Set the path to your VSSM document
const string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SampleFile.vssm";

// Initialize the converter with the source file path
var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
```

## Implementation Guide
Follow these steps to convert a VSSM file into an XLS format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

### Load Source VSSM File
Load your Visio Slide Show Macro-Enabled files for conversion by initializing the `Converter` object:
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

const string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SampleFile.vssm";
var converter = new Converter(documentPath);
```

### Convert VSSM to XLS Format
Convert the loaded VSSM file into an Excel spreadsheet.

#### Define Conversion Options
Set up `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` to specify the target format as XLS:
```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Specify the output directory and filename
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vssm-converted-to.xls");

// Configure conversion options for Excel format (XLS)
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```

#### Execute Conversion
Save the converted file by invoking the `Convert` method:
```csharp
// Convert and save the VSSM file as an XLS document
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your source VSSM file path is correct.
- Verify that you have write permissions for the output directory.

## Practical Applications
Converting VSSM files to XLS can be useful in scenarios such as:
