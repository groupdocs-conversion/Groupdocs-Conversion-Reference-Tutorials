        {
            string documentPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.odg";
            string outputPath = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\odg-converted-to.xlsx";

            using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
            {
                var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
                converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Convert ODG to XLSX
#### Overview
This feature demonstrates converting an OpenDocument Drawing File (.odg) into a Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx).

##### Step 1: Set Paths for Input and Output Directories
Define the paths for your input ODG file and output XLSX file. This setup allows dynamic path configuration:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.odg");
string outputPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "odg-converted-to.xlsx");
```

##### Step 2: Load the Source ODG File
Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your ODG file. This library streamlines the loading process, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here
}
```

##### Step 3: Define Conversion Options for XLSX Format
Specify that you want to convert your document into an Excel format using `SpreadsheetConvertOptions`.

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
```

##### Step 4: Convert and Save the Output as XLSX File
Execute the conversion and save the resulting file.

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputPath, options);
```

### Feature: Configurable Paths
#### Overview
This feature shows how to use configurable paths for input and output directories, enhancing flexibility in your application.

##### Step 1: Define Path Variables
Use placeholders for document and output directories, allowing easy path management.

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

##### Step 2: Combine Placeholders with Filenames
Combine directory paths with specific filenames to get full file paths dynamically:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.odg");
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "odg-converted-to.xlsx");

Console.WriteLine("Input file path: {0}", inputFilePath);
Console.WriteLine("Output file path: {0}", outputFilePath);
```

## Practical Applications
GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be integrated into various real-world scenarios:

1. **Data Migration Projects**: Convert legacy ODG files to modern XLSX formats during data migration.
2. **Automated Report Generation**: Automatically convert drawing-based reports into spreadsheets for analysis.

4. **Workflow Automation**: Streamline workflows that require frequent conversion of documents between different formats.
5. **Integration with Business Systems**: Enhance existing business applications by integrating GroupDocs.Conversion for seamless data exchange.

## Performance Considerations
When working with file conversions in .NET, consider these tips:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects appropriately using `using` statements to free up resources.
- **Handle Large Files Efficiently**: Implement asynchronous processing if dealing with large files to prevent blocking operations.
- **Follow Best Practices for Memory Management**: Regularly monitor and manage memory usage in your application to ensure smooth performance.
