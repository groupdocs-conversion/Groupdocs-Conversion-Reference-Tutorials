### Convert PPSM to XLSX

This feature helps you convert a PowerPoint Slide Show (.ppsm) into an Excel Open XML Spreadsheet (.xlsx).

#### Conversion Process Overview
We'll use the GroupDocs.Conversion library to load, convert, and save your files efficiently.

##### Step 1: Define Paths for Input and Output Directories
Set up paths for where your PPSM file is located and where you want the XLSX output:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "your-file.ppsm");
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; 
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ppsm-converted-to.xlsx");
```

##### Step 2: Load the PPSM Document
Create an instance of the `Converter` class to load your document:

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Proceed with conversion setup and execution.
}
```

##### Step 3: Initialize Conversion Options for XLSX Format
Set up the necessary options for converting into an Excel spreadsheet:

```csharp
var options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();

```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
