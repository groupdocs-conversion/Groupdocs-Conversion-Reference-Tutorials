# Convert XLSM to XLSX in .NET Using GroupDocs.Conversion: Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Converting XLSM files to the widely-used XLSX format can be challenging for businesses and developers. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, simplifying file conversion processes within your applications.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn:**
- Setting up GroupDocs.Conversion in a .NET environment.
- A step-by-step guide to converting XLSM files to XLSX.
- Key configuration options and troubleshooting tips.
- Practical applications of this functionality.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries, Versions, and Dependencies
- **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**: Version 25.3.0 is required for file conversion.

### Environment Setup Requirements
- A development environment with .NET Framework or .NET Core installed.
- Visual Studio or a compatible IDE that supports .NET applications.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming and file handling in .NET.
- Familiarity with using NuGet for managing packages.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Install the GroupDocs.Conversion library to start:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps
Start with a free trial or request a temporary license for full capabilities. For commercial use, purchase a license.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup
Initialize the conversion process in C#:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.xlsm");
        
        using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
        {
            var convertOptions = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
            
            // Specify the output format as XLSX
            convertOptions.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xlsx;
            
            string outputPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "converted.xlsx");
            converter.Convert(outputPath, convertOptions);
        }
    }
}
```
This code initializes a `Converter` object and configures it to convert an XLSM file into the XLSX format. Replace `"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"` and `"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"` with actual paths on your system.

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Load and Convert XLSM to XLSX
This feature allows you to load an XLSM file and convert it to XLSX, preserving all data including macros if necessary. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Set Up File Paths
Define the input and output paths for your files.
```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "example.xlsm");
string outputPath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "converted.xlsx");
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter
Create a `Converter` instance using the XLSM file path.
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion steps will be added here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Set up `SpreadsheetConvertOptions` to specify the output format as XLSX.
```csharp
var convertOptions = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions();
convertOptions.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xlsx;
```

#### Step 4: Execute Conversion
Use the `Convert` method, passing in your output path and conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputPath, convertOptions);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Access Issues**: Ensure file paths are correct and accessible. Check directory permissions if necessary.
- **Conversion Errors**: Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library is correctly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications
Converting XLSM to XLSX can be beneficial in scenarios like:
1. **Data Migration**: Ensures better interoperability when migrating data from legacy systems.
2. **Macro Preservation**: Retains macro functionality for broader use cases in business applications.
3. **Collaboration**: Facilitates easier sharing of files across different platforms and systems.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance:
- Dispose of `Converter` objects promptly to free up resources.
- Implement batch processing techniques for multiple file conversions.
- Adjust conversion options based on your speed-quality needs.

## Conclusion
You have learned how to convert XLSM files to XLSX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This capability is crucial for enhancing data interoperability and workflow efficiency in various business scenarios. Consider exploring other features of the library or integrating this solution into larger systems for automated batch processing.
