```

### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial and temporary licenses for extended testing. Visit their [purchase page](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy) or request a [temporary license](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/) to get started.

### Basic Initialization

Here's how you can initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the converter with a sample VDX file path
        using (var converter = new Converter("path/to/sample.vdx"))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialization complete.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Configure File Paths

**Overview**: Configuring file paths is crucial for specifying where your input and output files reside.

#### Step 1: Define Directories
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

#### Step 2: Combine Paths for Output File
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "vdx-converted-to.xls");
```

### Set Up File Conversion

**Overview**: Setting up conversion options allows you to specify the target format and other settings.

#### Step 1: Import Required Namespaces
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions {
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls // Target format set to XLS
};
```

### Execute File Conversion

**Overview**: This step involves executing the conversion process using the configured settings.

#### Step 1: Load and Convert the VDX File
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.vdx")))
{
    // Perform the conversion
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly set to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and licensed.
- Check for any updates or compatibility issues with your .NET version.
