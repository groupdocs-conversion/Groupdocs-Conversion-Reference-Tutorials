# Convert SVG to Excel with GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
## Introduction
In today's digital age, converting data formats efficiently is crucial. Converting Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files into Excel spreadsheets (XLS) can be challenging without the right tools. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET simplifies this process, making it seamless and efficient.

This guide will walk you through using GroupDocs.Conversion to convert SVG files to XLS format, providing a step-by-step approach suitable even for beginners.
**What You'll Learn:**
- How to set up and install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
- The process of converting SVG files to Excel (XLS) format.
- Key configuration options and troubleshooting tips.
- Real-world applications of the converted data.

Let's start by discussing what you need before diving into implementation.
## Prerequisites
Before implementing this conversion, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries:** GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET (Version 25.3.0).
- **Environment Setup:** A C# development environment like Visual Studio.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# and file handling in .NET.

With these prerequisites covered, let's explore how to set up GroupDocs.Conversion for your project.
## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
To use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, you need to install the library via NuGet Package Manager or directly through the .NET CLI:
### NuGet Package Manager Console
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```
### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```
After installation, acquire a license by opting for a free trial or purchasing from the [GroupDocs website](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy). For temporary access, apply for a temporary license [here](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).
Once your license is set up, initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your project:
```csharp
// Basic initialization of GroupDocs.Conversion
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string inputFilePath = "path/to/sample.svg";
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
This setup prepares you for the conversion process. Now, let's walk through converting SVG to Excel.
## Implementation Guide
### Overview of SVG to Excel Conversion
Converting SVG files to Excel spreadsheets allows you to handle graphical data within a tabular framework, facilitating easier analysis and reporting.
#### Step 1: Load Your Source File
Start by loading your source SVG file using the `Converter` class:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.svg");

using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // The conversion logic will be implemented here.
}
```
#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Specify the target format and any additional options for the conversion. Here, we're converting to XLS:
```csharp
SpreadsheetConvertOptions options = new SpreadsheetConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.SpreadsheetFileType.Xls };
```
#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the output file in your desired location:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "svg-converted-to.xls");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
With these steps, you've successfully converted an SVG to Excel format. If you encounter issues, ensure your input paths are correct and that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed.
### Troubleshooting Tips
