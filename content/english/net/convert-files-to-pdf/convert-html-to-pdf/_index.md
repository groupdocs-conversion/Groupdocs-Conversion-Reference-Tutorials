## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to seamlessly convert various document formats is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. Whether it's converting HTML web pages to PDFs for easy sharing or archiving, having the right tools can make all the difference. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to efficiently convert HTML web pages to PDF format.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Installation: Ensure that you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the necessary files from the [download link](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Sample HTML File: Have a sample HTML file ready that you want to convert to PDF. This will serve as our source file for conversion.
3. .NET Environment: Basic familiarity with .NET development and using libraries via NuGet packages.

## Import Namespaces
Before we begin the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Path
First, specify the output folder where you want to save the converted PDF file. You can choose any directory on your system.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "html-converted-to.pdf");
```
## Step 2: Load the Source HTML File
Next, load the source HTML file that you want to convert to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion's Converter class.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_HTML))
```
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options according to your requirements. In this case, we'll use PdfConvertOptions for converting HTML to PDF.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Now, perform the actual conversion by calling the Convert method of the Converter class and passing the output file path and conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Finally, let the user know that the conversion process has been completed successfully and provide the path where the converted PDF file is saved.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
