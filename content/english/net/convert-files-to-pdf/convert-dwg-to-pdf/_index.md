## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to convert DWG CAD files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. GroupDocs.Conversion is a powerful library that provides various document conversion functionalities.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Ensure you have installed the GroupDocs.Conversion library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Development Environment: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
3. DWG File: Have the DWG file that you want to convert ready in your local directory.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the conversion process, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Load the Source DWG File
Firstly, you need to load the source DWG file. This is done using the `Converter` class provided by GroupDocs.Conversion. 
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path_to_your_DWG_file"))
{
    // Your code here
}
```
Replace `"Path_to_your_DWG_file"` with the actual path to your DWG file.
## Step 2: Convert DWG to PDF
Once you've loaded the DWG file, you can specify conversion options and convert it to PDF. 
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
Here, we're creating `PdfConvertOptions` which provides various settings for the PDF conversion process.
## Step 3: Save the Converted PDF File
After specifying the conversion options, you can now convert the DWG file to PDF and save it.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your_Document_Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "dwg-converted-to.pdf");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Replace `"Your_Document_Directory"` with the directory where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 4: Display Completion Message
Once the conversion is completed successfully, you can display a message to inform the user about the location of the converted PDF file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This message will help users locate the converted file easily.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert DWG CAD files to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following these simple steps, you can seamlessly convert your DWG files to PDF format.
