## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert J2C (JPEG-LS Compressed) images to PDF format. GroupDocs.Conversion is a powerful document conversion library that allows developers to seamlessly convert various document formats in their .NET applications.
## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library: Download and install the library from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. .NET Development Environment: Make sure you have a working .NET development environment set up.
3. Sample J2C Image: Prepare a sample J2C image file that you want to convert to PDF.

## Import Namespaces
Before diving into the conversion process, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

## Step 1: Load the Source J2C File
To start the conversion process, you need to load the source J2C image file. Here's how you can do it:
```csharp

## Step 2: Define Conversion Options

```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Once you have loaded the source file and defined the conversion options, it's time to perform the actual conversion. Call the `Convert` method and specify the output file path:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "j2c-converted-to.pdf");
// Convert J2C to PDF
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 4: Check the Output
After the conversion is completed successfully, print a message indicating the completion and the location of the output file:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
