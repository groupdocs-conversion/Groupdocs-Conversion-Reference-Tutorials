# Convert JPEG-LS (.JLS) Files to PDF

## Introduction
In the realm of software development, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is often crucial. Whether it's for data migration, compatibility purposes, or simply streamlining workflows, having robust conversion capabilities can significantly enhance productivity. In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of converting JPEG-LS (.JLS) files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Make sure you have the necessary library installed in your development environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Sample JLS File: You'll need a sample JPEG-LS (.JLS) file to perform the conversion. If you don't have one, you can obtain it for testing purposes.
3. Development Environment: Set up your preferred .NET development environment, such as Visual Studio, with appropriate configurations.

## Import Namespaces
Before we get started with the conversion process, let's import the necessary namespaces to ensure smooth integration of GroupDocs.Conversion into our .NET project:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
First, specify the output folder where you want the converted PDF file to be saved, along with the desired file name.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "jls-converted-to.pdf");
```
Ensure that you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source JLS File
Next, load the source JPEG-LS (.JLS) file that you intend to convert to PDF format.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_JLS))
{
    // Conversion code will go here
}
```
Replace `Constants.SAMPLE_JLS` with the path to your actual JLS file.
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options. In this case, since we're converting to PDF, we'll use `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
You can adjust conversion options according to your requirements, such as setting resolution, page size, or specifying additional settings.
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process and save the converted PDF file using the specified options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Output Confirmation
Finally, display a message indicating the successful completion of the conversion process, along with the location where the converted PDF file is saved.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored the process of converting JPEG-LS (.JLS) files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By following the simple steps outlined above, you can seamlessly integrate file conversion capabilities into your .NET applications, enhancing their versatility and functionality.
