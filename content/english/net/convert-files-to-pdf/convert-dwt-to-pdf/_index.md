## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to convert DWT CAD template files to PDF format. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is a powerful document conversion library that allows you to convert various file formats seamlessly.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

## Import Namespaces

## Step 2: Load the Source DWT File and Convert to PDF
```csharp
// Load the source DWT file
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("Path_to_your_sample_DWT_file.dwt"))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Save converted PDF file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
Replace `"Path_to_your_sample_DWT_file.dwt"` with the path to your source DWT file.
## Step 3: Display Conversion Status
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
