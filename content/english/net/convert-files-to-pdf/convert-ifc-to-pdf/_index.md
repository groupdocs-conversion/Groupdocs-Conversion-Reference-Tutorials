# Convert IFC Building Information Modeling Files to PDF

## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to convert files from one format to another seamlessly is paramount. Whether you're dealing with documents, images, or specialized files like IFC Building Information Modeling (BIM) files, having the right tools can make all the difference. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of converting IFC files to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. 
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the conversion process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
### 1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
Ensure you have the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
### 2. Source IFC File
You'll need an IFC file that you want to convert to PDF. If you don't have one already, you can use a sample IFC file for testing purposes.

## Import Namespaces
To begin the conversion process, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project. 
## 1. Import GroupDocs.Conversion Namespace
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## 1. Define Output Folder and File
First, specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved and the name of the output file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ifc-converted-to.pdf");
```
## 2. Load the Source IFC File
Next, load the source IFC file using the GroupDocs.Conversion library.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_IFC))
{
    // Conversion code will be inserted here
}
```
## 3. Configure Conversion Options
Configure the conversion options, such as specifying the output format. In this case, we're converting to PDF.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## 4. Perform the Conversion
Initiate the conversion process using the `Convert` method, passing the output file path and conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## 5. Display Conversion Completion Message
Finally, inform the user that the conversion process has been completed successfully.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
