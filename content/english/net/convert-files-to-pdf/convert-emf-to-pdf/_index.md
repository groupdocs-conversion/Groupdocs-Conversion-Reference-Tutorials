## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of converting EMF (Enhanced Metafile) Windows Metafiles to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Ensure you have installed the GroupDocs.Conversion library for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. .NET Framework: You need to have the .NET Framework installed on your system.
3. Development Environment: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio to write and execute the code.
4. Source EMF Files: Prepare the EMF files that you want to convert to PDF.

## Import Namespaces
Before writing the code, import the necessary namespaces:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
## Step 1: Define Output Path
First, define the output folder and file path where the converted PDF will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "emf-converted-to.pdf");
```
Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want to save the converted PDF file.
## Step 2: Load the Source EMF File
Load the source EMF file using GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_EMF))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    // Save converted PDF file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
Make sure to replace `Constants.SAMPLE_EMF` with the path to your actual EMF file.
## Step 3: Convert and Save as PDF
Specify conversion options (if needed) and execute the conversion process:
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
This step sets up conversion options. You can customize these options based on your requirements, such as setting page size, margins, etc.
## Step 4: Check Output
After conversion, confirm the success and check the output folder:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to pdf completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
This line prints a success message along with the path where the converted PDF is saved.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert EMF Windows Metafiles to PDF format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. With just a few lines of code, you can easily convert your EMF files to PDF, facilitating better document management and compatibility.
