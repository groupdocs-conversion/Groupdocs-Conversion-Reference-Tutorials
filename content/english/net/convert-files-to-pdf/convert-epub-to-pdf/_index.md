## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to seamlessly convert file formats is a crucial aspect of managing digital documents. Whether you're dealing with eBooks, documents, or images, having the capability to convert them into different formats can greatly enhance their accessibility and usability. Among the myriad of file format conversions, converting EPUB eBooks to PDF holds significant importance due to PDF's universal compatibility and formatting stability.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the conversion process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Make sure you have the GroupDocs.Conversion library installed in your .NET environment. You can download it from [here](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/).
2. Sample EPUB File: Have an EPUB file ready that you want to convert to PDF. If you don't have one, you can obtain sample EPUB files from various online sources or create one yourself.

## Import Namespaces
In your .NET project, import the necessary namespaces to utilize GroupDocs.Conversion functionalities:
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```

## Step 1: Define Output Folder and File Name
First, specify the output folder where the converted PDF file will be saved, and provide a name for the output file.
```csharp
string outputFolder = "Your Document Directory";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "epub-converted-to.pdf");
```
## Step 2: Load the Source EPUB File
Next, load the source EPUB file using the GroupDocs.Conversion library.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(Constants.SAMPLE_EPUB))
{
    // Conversion code will be inserted here
}
```
## Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Set up the conversion options according to your requirements. In this case, we are converting EPUB to PDF, so create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`.
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
## Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process by calling the `Convert` method of the converter instance, passing the output file path and conversion options.
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
## Step 5: Display Completion Message
Finally, inform the user that the conversion process has been successfully completed and provide the path to the converted PDF file.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully. \nCheck output in {0}", outputFolder);
```
