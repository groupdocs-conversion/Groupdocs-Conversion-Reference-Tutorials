## Introduction
In today's digital age, the ability to seamlessly convert files from one format to another is crucial. Whether you're a developer working on a project or an individual looking to streamline your workflow, having access to reliable conversion tools can make all the difference. One such tool that has gained popularity among .NET developers is GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the world of converting ICO icons to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, there are a few prerequisites you'll need to have in place:
1. Basic Knowledge of .NET Framework: Familiarity with the .NET framework and C# programming language will be beneficial in understanding the code examples provided.
   
2. Installation of GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET: Ensure that you have GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from the [website](https://releases.groupdocs.com/conversion/net/) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.
3. ICO File to Convert: You'll need a sample ICO (Icon) file that you want to convert to PDF. Make sure you have the path to this file handy.

## Import Namespaces
To get started with converting ICO icons to PDF using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, you'll first need to import the necessary namespaces into your C# project. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required for file conversion.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;
```
This statement imports the `GroupDocs.Conversion` namespace, which contains the core functionality for file conversion.
## Step 1: Load the Source ICO File
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("path_to_your_ICO_file.ico"))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```
Replace `"path_to_your_ICO_file.ico"` with the actual path to your ICO file that you want to convert.
## Step 2: Set Conversion Options
```csharp
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
```
In this step, we create an instance of `PdfConvertOptions`, which allows you to specify conversion settings for the PDF output. You can customize various options such as page orientation, margins, and quality according to your requirements.
## Step 3: Perform the Conversion
```csharp
converter.Convert("path_to_output_PDF_file.pdf", options);
```
Here, we use the `Convert()` method of the `Converter` class to convert the ICO file to PDF. Replace `"path_to_output_PDF_file.pdf"` with the desired location and filename for the converted PDF file.
## Step 4: Check Conversion Status
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nConversion to PDF completed successfully.");
```
After the conversion process is complete, this step outputs a success message to the console.
