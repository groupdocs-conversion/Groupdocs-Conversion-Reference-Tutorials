## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation into logical sections.

### Feature 1: Load a PST File

Loading PST files correctly is crucial for accurate conversions.

#### Overview

This feature allows you to load your PST files for conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Initialize and Configure**

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Load;

string sourcePstPath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.pst";
var converter = new Converter(sourcePstPath, (LoadContext loadContext) =>
{
    // Ensure the file is a PST type before applying specific options.
    return loadContext.SourceFormat == EmailFileType.Pst ? new PersonalStorageLoadOptions() : null;
});
```

- **Parameters**: `sourcePstPath` specifies the location of your source PST file.
- **Return Values**: The `PersonalStorageLoadOptions()` configures loading based on PST specifications.

### Feature 2: Convert to PDF

Converting your loaded PST file into a user-friendly PDF document makes it easier to share and archive email data.

#### Overview

This conversion facilitates better accessibility and sharing of data.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**Perform the Conversion**

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFilePattern = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pst-converted-{0}-to.pdf");
var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
int counter = 1;

// Convert and save the PST file as a PDF.
converter.Convert(
    (SaveContext saveContext) => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFilePattern, counter++), FileMode.Create),
    options
);
```

- **Parameters**: `outputFolder` is where converted files will be saved. The `outputFilePattern` ensures each file has a unique name.
- **Return Values**: A PDF document created for each conversion process.

### Troubleshooting Tips
