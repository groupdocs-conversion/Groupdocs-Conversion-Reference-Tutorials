   string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
   string cgmFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.cgm");
   ```

2. **Load Using GroupDocs.Conversion:**
   - Use the `Converter` class to load your file.
   ```csharp
   using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(cgmFilePath))
   {
       // The source CGM file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
   }
   ```

### Configuring Conversion Options to PPT Format

   ```csharp
   string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "cgm-converted-to.ppt");

   using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(cgmFilePath))
   {
       // Convert and save the CGM file to PPT format.
