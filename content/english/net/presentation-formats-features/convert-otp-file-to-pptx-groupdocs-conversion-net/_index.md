## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process:

### Load OTP File
**Overview**: Prepare your OTP file for conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion.

1. **Load the File**
   - Use the `Converter` class to load the OTP file from a specified path.

   ```csharp
   string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.otp");
   var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath);
   ```

   *Explanation*: The `Converter` object is initialized with the OTP file, ready for conversion operations.

### Convert OTP to PPTX
**Overview**: Focus on converting an OTP file into a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX).

1. **Set Up Output Directory**
   - Ensure your output directory exists.

   ```csharp
   string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
   Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
   ```

2. **Define Conversion Options**
   - Specify conversion settings using `PresentationConvertOptions`.

   ```csharp
   var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
   ```

3. **Perform the Conversion**
   - Use the `Convert` method to transform and save the file.

   ```csharp
   string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "otp-converted-to.pptx");
   converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
   ```

   *Explanation*: The conversion process occurs here, resulting in a PPTX file saved in your designated directory.
