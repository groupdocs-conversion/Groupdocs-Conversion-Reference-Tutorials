// Ensure directories are correctly set and exist.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert OneNote to PowerPoint

This feature allows you to convert Microsoft OneNote (.one) files into PowerPoint Presentation Open XML format (.pptx).

#### Step 1: Configure Your Document Paths

Define the paths for your input and output directories:
```csharp
string YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
// Ensure these paths are correctly set to where your files are located.
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source ONE File

Load your .one file using the Converter class from GroupDocs.Conversion:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY + "/sample.one"))
{
    // The 'converter' object is now ready to handle conversion tasks.
}
```

#### Step 3: Define Conversion Options

Set up the options for converting to PowerPoint format using PresentationConvertOptions:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
// These options dictate how the file will be converted.
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion and save the output as a .pptx file:
```csharp
string outputFile = YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY + "/one-converted-to.pptx";
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
// The file is now saved in your specified output directory.
```

### Feature: File Path Configuration

Ensure your directories are correctly set up for input and output.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory

Obtain the full path to where you'll save your converted files:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY);
if (!Directory.Exists(outputFolder))
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder); // Create directory if it doesn't exist.
}
```

#### Step 2: Define Output File Path

Set the path for where you want to save the converted file:
