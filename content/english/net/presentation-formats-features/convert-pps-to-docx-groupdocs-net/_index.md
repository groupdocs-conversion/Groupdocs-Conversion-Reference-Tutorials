            // Initialize the converter with a PPS file
            using (var converter = new Converter(ppsFilePath))
            {
                // The file is ready for conversion.
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Loading a PPS File

Loading your source PPS file is the first step in any conversion process. It ensures that you have access to the file data required for transformation.

#### Step 1: Load the Source PPS File
To load a PPS file, use the following code snippet:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Define your source PPS file path
string ppsFilePath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pps";

// Initialize the converter with the specified PPS file
using (var converter = new Converter(ppsFilePath))
{
    // The file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
}
```

### Converting PPS to DOCX

With your PPS file successfully loaded, you can proceed to convert it into a Word document.

#### Step 2: Define Conversion Options
Set up the desired output format using `WordProcessingConvertOptions`.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Specify conversion options for DOCX format
var options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Finally, execute the conversion and save your file in the desired location.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string outputFolder = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pps-converted-to.docx");

// Load the source PPS file
using (var converter = new Converter("@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pps"))
{
    // Convert and save the output DOCX file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
