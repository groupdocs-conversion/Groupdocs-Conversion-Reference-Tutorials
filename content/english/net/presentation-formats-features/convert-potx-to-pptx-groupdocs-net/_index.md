```

## Implementation Guide

### Step-by-Step Conversion Process

**Overview:**
This section guides you through converting a .potx file into a .pptx format using C#. The process is straightforward with GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### 1. Load Your POTX File
Start by loading your source POTX file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```
**Explanation:** The `Converter` class manages the conversion process, taking a file path as its parameter.

#### 2. Define Conversion Options
Set up your presentation conversion options to specify PPTX format:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```
**Explanation:** `PresentationConvertOptions` allows customization of the output for PowerPoint compatibility.

#### 3. Convert and Save the PPTX File
Execute the conversion and save the output file in your desired directory:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted.pptx");

converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
**Explanation:** The `Convert` method performs the actual conversion based on specified options and saves the resulting file.

### Troubleshooting Tips
