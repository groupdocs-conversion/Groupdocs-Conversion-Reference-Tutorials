### What You'll Learn:
- How to load an XPS file using GroupDocs.Conversion.
- Steps to convert an XPS file into a PPTX presentation.
- Key setup and configuration details for GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped to handle document conversion tasks efficiently. Let's begin with the prerequisites required before implementation.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the XPS to PPTX conversion using **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**, ensure:
- **Required Libraries**: GroupDocs.Conversion library version 25.3.0 or later.
- **Environment Setup**: Compatible development environment, such as Visual Studio, and C# code examples are provided.
- **Knowledge Prerequisites**: Familiarity with .NET programming and basic understanding of file conversion processes.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

Install the necessary package via NuGet Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI:

### NuGet Package Manager Console
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### .NET CLI
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

#### License Acquisition

To leverage **GroupDocs.Conversion** fully:
- Start with a free trial.
- Obtain a temporary license for extensive testing.
- Purchase a full license for production use.

For more information on acquiring licenses, visit [GroupDocs Licensing](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/temporary-license/).

### Basic Initialization and Setup

Set up **GroupDocs.Conversion** in your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize the converter with an XPS file path
var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/xps-file.xps");
```
This snippet demonstrates creating a `Converter` object, essential for document conversions.

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load XPS File

#### Overview
The first step in converting an XPS file to PPTX is loading the source file. GroupDocs.Conversion allows seamless loading using its API.

##### Step 1: Specify the Path of Your XPS Document
Define your XPS document's storage location:
```csharp
string inputFilePath = "@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/xps-file.xps";
```

##### Step 2: Initialize the Converter
Create an instance of the `Converter` class with the specified file path:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // The converter is now ready for conversion operations.
}
```
Here, we use a `using` statement to manage resources effectively after loading the file.

### Feature 2: Convert XPS to PPTX

#### Overview
Once your XPS file is loaded, proceed with converting it into a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX format).

##### Step 1: Define Output Directory and File Path
Set up where you want to save the converted file:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xps-converted-to.pptx");
```

##### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Configure conversion settings for the target format:
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```
The `PresentationConvertOptions` class configures PowerPoint-specific settings.

##### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This method uses your configured options to perform the document transformation.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure that the input XPS path is correct and accessible.
- Verify that the output directory has write permissions.
- Check for any exceptions thrown during conversion and handle them appropriately.

## Practical Applications
Converting XPS to PPTX can be useful in various scenarios:
1. **Business Presentations**: Transform archival documents into modern presentations for meetings or pitches.
2. **Educational Content**: Convert course materials from static formats into interactive presentations.
3. **Archiving Solutions**: Maintain consistent file format across departments by converting legacy files.

GroupDocs.Conversion can also be integrated with other .NET systems, making it versatile for enterprise applications.

## Performance Considerations
To optimize performance using GroupDocs.Conversion:
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Dispose of resources promptly after use.
- **Batch Processing**: Convert multiple documents in a single run to minimize overhead.
- **Resource Management**: Monitor CPU and memory usage during conversions, especially with large files.

Following these best practices will ensure efficient document conversion processes.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to effectively convert XPS files to PPTX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. By setting up the environment, initializing the converter, and executing the conversion process, you can significantly streamline your document management workflow.
