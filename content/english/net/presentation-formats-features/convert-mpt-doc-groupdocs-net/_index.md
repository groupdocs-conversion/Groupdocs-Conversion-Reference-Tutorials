{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the converter with a sample MPT file path
            var converter = new Converter("sample.mpt");
            
            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's focus on converting an MPT file to DOC format.

### Feature: Load and Convert MPT File
#### Overview
This feature involves loading a Microsoft Project Template (.mpt) file and converting it into a Word document (DOC). This conversion is crucial for scenarios where project data needs to be reviewed or edited in common word processing software.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
##### 1. Define Output Directory
First, specify the directory where your converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "ConvertedFiles");
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);
```
Here we ensure that the directory exists to prevent any file path errors during conversion.

##### 2. Specify Input and Output Paths
Set up the input MPT file path and define where your DOC file will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "mpt-converted-to.doc");
string mptFilePath = Path.Combine(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mpt");
```

##### 3. Load and Convert the File
Using GroupDocs.Conversion, load the MPT file and convert it to DOC:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(mptFilePath))
{
    WordProcessingConvertOptions options = new WordProcessingConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.WordProcessingFileType.Doc };
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```
In this step, the `WordProcessingConvertOptions` class is pivotal. It allows you to specify the output format as DOC.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing File Errors**: Ensure your file paths are correctly set.
- **Conversion Failures**: Verify that the input MPT file is not corrupted and is accessible.

## Practical Applications
Here are some scenarios where converting MPT files to DOC can be particularly useful:
1. **Project Documentation Review**: Sharing project templates in a more editable format for review purposes.
2. **Client Presentations**: Providing clients with detailed project plans that they can easily access on various devices.
3. **Integration with Other Systems**: Exporting data from Microsoft Project into systems that require textual input, such as CRM or ERP software.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure optimal performance during conversion:
- Use the latest version of GroupDocs.Conversion to benefit from improvements and bug fixes.
- Monitor memory usage, especially when dealing with large MPT files. Dispose of unused objects to free up resources promptly.
- Consider asynchronous processing if you're integrating this feature into a larger application.
