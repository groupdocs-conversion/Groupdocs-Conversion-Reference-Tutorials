## Implementation Guide

Now that you’re set up, let’s look at how to implement the OXPS to PPT conversion.

### Loading an OXPS File
#### Overview:
The first step is loading your source OXPS file into the GroupDocs.Conversion library.

**Step 1: Define Your Document Directory**

string inputDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
string sampleOxpsFile = Path.Combine(inputDirectory, "sample.oxps"); // Replace with your actual OXPS filename
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source File
Here’s how you can load an OXPS file:
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sampleOxpsFile))
{
    // The converter object is now ready for operations.
}
```
- **Parameters:** Path to your OXPS file.
- **Purpose:** Loads the document, enabling conversion actions.

### Converting OXPS to PPT
#### Overview:
Once loaded, you can convert your OXPS file into a PowerPoint presentation using specific conversion options.

**Step 1: Define Output Directory and File**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "oxps-converted-to.ppt");
```

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Configure your conversion settings for PowerPoint format:
```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions { Format = PresentationFileType.Ppt };
```
- **Purpose:** Specifies the desired output format.
