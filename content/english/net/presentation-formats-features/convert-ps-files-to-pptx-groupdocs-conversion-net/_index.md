## Implementation Guide

### Convert PS File to PPTX Format

Transforming a PostScript (PS) file into PowerPoint Open XML Presentation (.pptx) format involves the following steps:

#### Step 1: Define Paths
Specify paths for your source PS file and output directory.
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.ps");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ps-converted-to.pptx");
```
#### Step 2: Load and Convert the Source File
Use the `Converter` class to load your PS file and set conversion options.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions(); // Configure for PPTX format
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Perform the conversion
}
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- `sourceFilePath`: Path to your input PS file.
- `outputFile`: Destination path for the converted PPTX file.
- `PresentationConvertOptions()`: Specifies conversion to PowerPoint format.

#### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible.
