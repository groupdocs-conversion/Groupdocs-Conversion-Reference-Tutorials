namespace ConversionExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize a license if you have one
            License license = new License();
            license.SetLicense("path/to/your/license.lic");

            Console.WriteLine("GroupDocs.Conversion initialized successfully.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's implement the conversion feature step-by-step.

### Convert OXPS File to PPTX Format

This section explains how to convert an OXPS file into a PPTX format using GroupDocs.Conversion library.

#### Step 1: Define Paths and Initialize Converter

Firstly, define your input and output paths. This includes the location of your source OXPS file and where you want the converted PPTX file to be saved.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define the output directory path as a placeholder
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string inputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.oxps"); // Replace with your OXPS file path
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "oxps-converted-to.pptx");
```

#### Step 2: Perform the Conversion

Load the source OXPS file and convert it using the `GroupDocs.Conversion` class.

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFile))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions(); // Initialize conversion options for PPTX format
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options); // Convert and save the output PPTX file
}
```

**Parameters Explained:**
- `inputFile`: Path to your source OXPS file.
- `outputFile`: Desired path for the converted PPTX file.
- `PresentationConvertOptions()`: Configures settings specifically for converting into presentation formats.

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure that the input OXPS file is not corrupted.
- Verify you have write permissions to the output directory.
- Check if your GroupDocs.Conversion license has expired or needs activation.

## Practical Applications

Converting OXPS files to PPTX format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET can be beneficial in various scenarios:

1. **Corporate Presentations:** Automatically convert design drafts from XPS format into editable PowerPoint presentations.
2. **Academic Projects:** Simplify the process of preparing academic content by converting lecture notes or diagrams stored in OXPS to PPTX.
3. **Marketing Campaigns:** Quickly transform marketing collateral files for easy sharing and editing during campaign planning sessions.

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Performance:
- Use efficient file handling practices to minimize memory usage.
- Convert files in batches when dealing with multiple documents to better manage resources.

### Best Practices for .NET Memory Management:
- Dispose of objects properly using `using` statements or explicitly calling the `.Dispose()` method.
- Monitor application performance regularly and optimize code as needed to handle large files efficiently.
