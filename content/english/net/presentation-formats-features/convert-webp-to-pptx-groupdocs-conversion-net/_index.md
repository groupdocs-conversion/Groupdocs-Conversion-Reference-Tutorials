Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have everything needed.

## Prerequisites

To convert your WEBP files using **GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**, you'll need:

### Required Libraries and Dependencies
Ensure that you have:
- A supported version of the .NET framework (preferably .NET Core 3.1 or later)
- Visual Studio 2017 or a newer version installed

### Environment Setup Requirements
Install GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET to set up your development environment.

### Knowledge Prerequisites
A basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with file handling in .NET applications will be beneficial.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To start, install the **GroupDocs.Conversion** library through NuGet or the .NET CLI:

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Purchase**: For full access and support, purchase a license at the [GroupDocs store](https://purchase.groupdocs.com/buy).

### Basic Initialization
Initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

namespace WebpToPptxConversion
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Initialize the converter with the path to your WEBP file.
            string webpFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.webp";
            
            using (var converter = new Converter(webpFilePath))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Conversion setup initialized.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we set up the environment and load a WEBP file into the GroupDocs.Conversion library.

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the implementation for converting your WEBP files to PPTX format:

### Load Source WEBP File
#### Overview
Load a source WEBP file using GroupDocs.Conversion, preparing it for conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Define the WebP file path:**
```csharp
string webpFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.webp";
```

**2. Load the WEBP file:**
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(webpFilePath))
{
    // The conversion process will be handled in a subsequent step.
}
```

This snippet loads the WEBP file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class, preparing it for conversion.

### Convert WEBP to PPTX
#### Overview
Focus on converting the loaded WEBP file into PowerPoint presentation format (PPTX).

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
**1. Set Output Path:**
```csharp
string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "webp-converted-to.pptx");
```

**2. Convert and Save the File:**
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(webpFilePath))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
    
    // Perform the conversion from WEBP to PPTX.
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

This snippet demonstrates converting a WEBP file into PPTX format using `PresentationConvertOptions` for PowerPoint presentation output.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correct and accessible.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library version is compatible with your .NET environment.
- Check for exceptions during conversion to diagnose issues quickly.
