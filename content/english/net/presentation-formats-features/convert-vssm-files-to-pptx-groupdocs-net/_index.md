#### License Acquisition

GroupDocs offers a free trial version that allows you to evaluate the library's features. For full functionality, consider obtaining a temporary license or purchasing a subscription through their official website.

### Basic Initialization and Setup with C#

To get started with converting files, initialize the `Converter` class and specify your input file:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string inputFilePath = "sample.vssm";
        string outputFolder = "output";
        string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vssm-converted-to.pptx");

        using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
        {
            var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
            converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Overview of the Feature

This feature focuses on converting VSSM files into PPTX format. The process involves loading a VSSM file and applying conversion settings to output it as a PowerPoint presentation.

#### Loading and Setting Up Conversion Options
1. **Load the Source File**
   - Use the `Converter` class to load your VSSM file.
   
2. **Set Up Conversion Options**
   - Initialize `PresentationConvertOptions` for PPTX conversion.
   
3. **Perform the Conversion**
   - Call the `Convert` method with specified options to save as a PPTX file.

#### Code Explanation

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

- **Converter**: This class handles the conversion process. The `using` statement ensures proper disposal of resources.
  
- **PresentationConvertOptions**: Configures settings specific to PowerPoint conversion.
  
- **Convert Method**: Executes the conversion and writes the output to a PPTX file specified by `outputFile`.
