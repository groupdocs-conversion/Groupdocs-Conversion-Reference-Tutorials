    static void Main()
    {

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the process of converting PPTX files to HTML into clear steps.

### Loading and Converting PPTX to HTML
#### Overview
Converting a PowerPoint file to an HTML format allows it to be viewed on any web browser, making sharing more flexible. This section covers loading a PPTX file and performing the conversion using GroupDocs.Conversion.

##### Step 1: Define File Paths
You need placeholders for input and output paths:
```csharp
string pptxFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.pptx");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pptx-converted-to.html");
```
##### Step 2: Load the PPTX File
Using GroupDocs.Conversion, load your source file with a `Converter` object:
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(pptxFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here.
}
```
The `Converter` class handles loading and converting documents.
##### Step 3: Initialize HTML Conversion Options
Set up the conversion options for HTML format:
```csharp
var options = new WebConvertOptions();
```
This specifies that the output should be in HTML format, suitable for web browsers.
##### Step 4: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the result:
```csharp
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
Here, `Convert` method performs the actual file transformation, writing the converted HTML to your specified path.
#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure input file paths are correct.
- Check for write permissions in the output directory.
- Handle exceptions that may arise during conversion to ensure robustness.
