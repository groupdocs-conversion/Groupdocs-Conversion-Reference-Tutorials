## Implementation Guide

### Convert PPT to PPTX

#### Overview

This feature will guide you through converting PowerPoint `.ppt` files into the `.pptx` format using C# and GroupDocs.Conversion.

**Step 1: Define Source and Output Paths**

Start by setting up your directories for input and output paths. Make sure these are correctly set to avoid file path errors:

```csharp
private static string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
private static string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
```

**Step 2: Load the PPT File**

Load the `.ppt` file using the `Converter` class, which initializes the conversion process.

```csharp
string inputFile = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.ppt");
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion logic follows
}
```

**Step 3: Set Conversion Options**

Configure your conversion settings with `PresentationConvertOptions`. This step allows you to customize how the file is converted.

```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

**Step 4: Perform the Conversion**

Finally, convert and save the `.ppt` file as a `.pptx`.

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "ppt-converted-to.pptx");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **File Not Found**: Ensure that your paths are correct and files exist at specified locations.
- **Permission Issues**: Check directory permissions to ensure read/write access.

## Practical Applications

Explore these real-world use cases:
1. **Automated Reporting Systems**: Convert batch `.ppt` reports into `.pptx` for modern display compatibility.
2. **Document Management Systems**: Integrate conversion features in systems that archive or migrate older presentations.
3. **Collaboration Tools**: Enhance tools by providing users with the option to convert their files seamlessly.

## Performance Considerations

- **Optimize File Paths**: Use relative paths for better portability and resource management.
- **Manage Memory Usage**: Dispose of objects promptly to free up resources after conversion tasks.
- **Batch Processing**: For large volumes, consider processing files in batches to prevent memory overload.
