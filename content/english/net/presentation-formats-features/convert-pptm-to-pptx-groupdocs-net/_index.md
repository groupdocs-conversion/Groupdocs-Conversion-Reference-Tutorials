```csharp
string inputFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\\\sample.pptm";
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "pptm-converted-to.pptx");
```

#### Step 2: Load and Convert the File

Load your PPTM file using the `Converter` class and set up conversion options:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
