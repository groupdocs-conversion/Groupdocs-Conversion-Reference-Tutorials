### Converting STL to PPT: A Step-by-Step Approach

This section will guide you through converting an STL file into a PowerPoint presentation.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

Specify your document and output directories:

```csharp
string documentDirectory = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your actual path
string outputDirectory = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your desired output path
```

#### Step 2: Load the STL File

Use `GroupDocs.Conversion` to load your source file:

```csharp
var stlFilePath = Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.stl");
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(stlFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

#### Step 3: Configure PowerPoint Options

Set up conversion options for PowerPoint format:

```csharp
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt 
};
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Convert and save your file:

```csharp
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "stl-converted-to.ppt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you encounter issues during conversion, consider these tips:

- Ensure `sample.stl` exists in the specified document directory.
- Verify that your output directory is writable.
- Check for exceptions thrown by GroupDocs.Conversion and refer to their documentation.
