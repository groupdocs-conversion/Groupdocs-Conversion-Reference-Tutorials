## Implementation Guide

This section will guide you through converting a VSD file to PPTX using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Load and Convert the File
#### Overview
This feature allows loading of a VSD file and its conversion into PPTX format, ideal for presenting Visio diagrams as PowerPoint slideshows.

#### Implementation Steps
##### Step 1: Initialize Converter Object
Create an instance of the `Converter` class using your source VSD file path. This object manages the conversion process.
```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Initialize `PresentationConvertOptions`. This specifies converting to a PowerPoint presentation format.
```csharp
var options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

##### Step 3: Execute the Conversion
Call the `Convert` method, passing in your desired output path and conversion options. This saves your VSD file as a PPTX file.
```csharp
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "vsd-converted-to.pptx");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
