}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load Source OTP File

**Overview:**
The first step is loading the OTP file to prepare it for conversion.

#### Step 1: Define Your Document Path

Set a path variable pointing to your .otp file:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.otp";
```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Converter

Load your OTP file using GroupDocs.Conversion:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here in subsequent steps
}
```

### Convert OTP to PPT Format

**Overview:**
This section demonstrates converting an OTP file into a PowerPoint presentation using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Specify Output Directory and File Name

Define where your converted file will be saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "otp-converted-to.ppt");
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options

Set the desired format for conversion using `PresentationConvertOptions`:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.otp"))
