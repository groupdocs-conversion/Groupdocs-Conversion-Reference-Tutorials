            string aiFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\\\sample.ai"; // Replace with actual file path
            Converter converter = new Converter(aiFilePath);
            Console.WriteLine("Converter initialized.");
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature: Convert AI File to PPTX Format

This section covers the steps required to convert an Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file into a PowerPoint presentation (.pptx).

#### Step 1: Create a Converter Instance
Begin by creating a `Converter` instance, passing your .ai file path as a parameter. This step initializes the conversion process.

```csharp
// Initialize the Converter with an AI file path
string aiFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\\\sample.ai"; // Replace with actual file path
Converter converter = new Converter(aiFilePath);
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options for PowerPoint Format
Define your conversion options using `PresentationConvertOptions`. This specifies that you want to convert the document into a PowerPoint format.

```csharp
// Define options for converting to PowerPoint format
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Convert and Save the Output as PPTX
Execute the conversion process and save the output file in your specified directory. This step finalizes the conversion of your .ai file into a .pptx format.

```csharp
// Specify the output directory and file name
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = outputFolder + "/ai-converted-to.pptx";

// Perform conversion and save the result
converter.convert(outputFile, options);
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- Ensure your AI file path is correct.
- Verify that you have write permissions to the output directory.
- Check for any version conflicts in GroupDocs.Conversion dependencies.
