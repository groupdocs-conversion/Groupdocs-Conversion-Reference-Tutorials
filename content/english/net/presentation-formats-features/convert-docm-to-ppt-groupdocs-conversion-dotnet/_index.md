using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Initialize the converter with your DOCM file path
string sourceDocmPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.docm");
```

This simple setup prepares you to start converting documents.

## Implementation Guide

### Convert DOCM to PPT

Let’s break down the conversion process step-by-step:

#### Load the Source DOCM File

First, initialize and load your DOCM file. This is where GroupDocs.Conversion starts its magic.
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(sourceDocmPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here.
}
```

#### Set Conversion Options for PowerPoint Format

Next, define the conversion options to specify that you want a PPT output.
```csharp
// Set up options for converting to PowerPoint format
PresentationConvertOptions options = new PresentationConvertOptions 
{ 
    Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PresentationFileType.Ppt 
};
```

#### Convert and Save the DOCM File as a PPT

Finally, perform the conversion and save your file.
```csharp
// Execute conversion and save the output PPT file
string outputFile = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "docm-converted-to.ppt");
converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
