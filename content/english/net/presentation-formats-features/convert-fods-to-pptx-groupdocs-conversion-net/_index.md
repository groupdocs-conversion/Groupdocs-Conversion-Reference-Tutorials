## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s walk through the steps required to convert your FODS files into PPTX format.

### Load Your FODS File and Convert It

1. **Overview:** This feature allows you to load a FODS document and directly convert it into a PowerPoint presentation (PPTX).

2. **Setup Conversion Options:**
   First, specify the output directory where your converted file will be saved:

   ```csharp
   string outputFolder = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your path
   ```

3. **Implement the Conversion Logic:**

   Here's how you convert a FODS to PPTX using GroupDocs.Conversion:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.IO;
   using GroupDocs.Conversion;
   using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main()
       {
           string outputFolder = "@YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Replace with your path
           string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "fods-converted-to.pptx");

           // Initialize the converter object with your FODS file.
           using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("@YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\\sample.fods"))
           {
               var options = new PresentationConvertOptions(); // Create conversion options for PPTX format

               // Convert and save the output file
               converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - **Parameters Explained:** 
     - `outputFile` is the path where your converted presentation will be saved.
     - `PresentationConvertOptions()` sets up the conversion to PPTX format.

4. **Troubleshooting Tips:**
   - Ensure paths are correctly set for both input and output files.
   - Verify that you have necessary permissions to read from and write to specified directories.
