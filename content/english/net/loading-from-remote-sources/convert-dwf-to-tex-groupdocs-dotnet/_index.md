    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert DWF to TEX Feature

This feature allows you to convert a DWF file into TeX format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Load the DWF File
First, load your source DWF file into the converter object.

```csharp
// Load the source DWF file
to do this:
using (Converter converter = new Converter("path/to/your/input.dwf"))
{
    // Conversion logic will be added here
}
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Specify the target format as TeX and configure any necessary options to tailor the conversion process.

```csharp
// Setup conversion options for TEX format
var texOptions = new TexConvertOptions();
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Now, convert your loaded DWF file into a TeX document by calling the `Convert` method with appropriate options.

```csharp
// Convert and save the output as a .tex file
converter.Convert("path/to/your/output.tex", texOptions);
```

### Key Configuration Options:
- **TexConvertOptions:** Customize conversion parameters such as font settings and page layout.
- **Troubleshooting Tips:**
  - Ensure correct and accessible input DWF file path.
  - Verify output directory has write permissions.
