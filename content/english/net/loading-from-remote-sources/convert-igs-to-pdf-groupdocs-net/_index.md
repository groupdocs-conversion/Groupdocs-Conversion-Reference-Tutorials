        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Set license if you have one
            // License lic = new License();
            // lic.SetLicense("GroupDocs.Conversion.lic");

            string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.igs";
            using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
            {
                // Ready to perform conversion operations
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load IGES File

#### Overview:
Loading an IGES file is the first step before any conversion can take place. This ensures your application recognizes and handles IGES files appropriately.

**Step 1: Set the Input Path**

```csharp
string inputFilePath = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.igs";
```
*Explanation:* Define the path to your source IGES file. Ensure it's accessible by your application.

#### Step 2: Initialize Converter

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // The converter object is now ready for conversion operations.
}
```
*Explanation:* This snippet initializes the `Converter` object, which serves as the main interface for file conversion operations. It takes your input file path as a parameter.

### Convert IGES to PDF

#### Overview:
Once loaded, you can convert an IGES file into a PDF format using specific options provided by GroupDocs.Conversion.

**Step 1: Set the Output Path**

```csharp
string outputFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(@"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.pdf");
```
*Explanation:* Define where the converted PDF file will be saved. Ensure the directory exists or create it within your code logic.

#### Step 2: Convert to PDF

```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    var options = new PdfConvertOptions();
    converter.Convert(outputFilePath, options);
}
```
*Explanation:* This snippet demonstrates the conversion process. The `PdfConvertOptions` class specifies parameters for converting files into PDF format.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- If an exception occurs during file loading or conversion, verify your file paths and permissions.
- Ensure GroupDocs.Conversion is correctly installed and referenced in your project.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion can be integrated into various real-world use cases:
1. **Automated Document Workflows:** Streamline document processing by converting CAD drawings to universally accessible PDFs for client reviews.
2. **Archiving Systems:** Convert legacy IGES files into modern formats for easier data preservation and retrieval.
3. **Cross-Platform Sharing:** Facilitate sharing of technical drawings across different platforms where PDF is widely supported.

## Performance Considerations

To ensure your application runs smoothly:
- **Optimize Resource Usage:** Limit the number of simultaneous conversions to manage memory usage efficiently.
- **Follow Best Practices:** Utilize .NET's garbage collection and dispose of objects properly to prevent memory leaks, especially when dealing with large files.
