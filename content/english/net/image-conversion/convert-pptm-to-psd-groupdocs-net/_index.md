## Implementation Guide

We'll break down the conversion process into clear steps.

### Feature Overview: Converting PPTM to PSD

GroupDocs.Conversion allows you to transform various document formats easily. Here, we focus on converting a PowerPoint presentation (PPTM) into an Adobe Photoshop Document (PSD).

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter
```csharp
using (var converter = new GroupDocs.Conversion.Converter("input.pptm"))
{
    // Conversion code will be added here.
}
```
- **Purpose**: Initializes a `Converter` object for your source file.

#### Step 2: Define Conversion Options

Specify the target format and any specific options required for conversion:
```csharp
var options = new PsdConvertOptions();
```
- **Parameters**: `PsdConvertOptions()` sets up default settings for PSD output.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Invoke the conversion method to transform the PPTM file into a PSD format:
```csharp
converter.Convert("output.psd", options);
```
- **Explanation**: Converts and saves the presentation as an Adobe Photoshop Document.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your input files are accessible and not corrupted.
