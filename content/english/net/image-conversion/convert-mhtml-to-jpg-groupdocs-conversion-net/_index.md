## Implementation Guide
### Conversion of MHTML to JPG
This section will guide you through converting an MHTML file into JPG images using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths and Output Template
Set up your source and output paths. This ensures that each page is saved separately.

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.mhtml");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");
```

#### Step 2: Create a Function for Page Stream Generation
Define a function that generates a stream for each page of conversion. This is crucial for saving each page as a separate JPG file.

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 3: Load and Convert the MHTML File
Load your source file and configure the conversion options to target the JPG format.

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Jpg };
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
**Key Configuration Options:**
- `ImageConvertOptions`: Specifies that we are converting to an image format.
- `Format = ImageFileType.Jpg`: Sets the target format as JPG.

#### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure file paths are correctly specified and accessible.
- Verify that you have write permissions for the output directory.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where MHTML to JPG conversion can be beneficial:
1. **Web Archiving**: Convert web pages into image files for easy archiving and sharing.
2. **Content Sharing**: Share snapshots of web content with stakeholders who prefer images over HTML files.
3. **Integration with Document Management Systems**: Automate the conversion process within larger document management workflows.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure smooth performance during conversions:
- Optimize memory usage by managing file streams properly.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large documents.
- Regularly monitor resource utilization to prevent bottlenecks.
