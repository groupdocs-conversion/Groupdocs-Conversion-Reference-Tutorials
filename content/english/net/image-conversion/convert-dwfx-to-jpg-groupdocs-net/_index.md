## Implementation Guide

Now, let’s break down the implementation process into manageable steps.

### Load and Convert DWFX File to JPG

#### Step 1: Initialize the Converter
Start by loading your DWFX file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class. This step sets up your file for conversion.
```csharp
var converter = new Converter("path/to/your/file.dwfx");
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options

```csharp
var options = new ImageConvertOptions
{
    Format = FileTypes.Jpg // Specify the target file format as JPG
};
```
**Parameters Explained:**
- `Format`: Defines the output image format. In this case, we're converting to JPG.

#### Step 3: Execute Conversion
Finally, convert and save your DWFX file as a JPG:
```csharp
converter.Convert("output/path/converted.jpg", options);
