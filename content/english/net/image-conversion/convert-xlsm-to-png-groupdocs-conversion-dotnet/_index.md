{
    public void SetLicense(string path)
    {
        // Simulated method for setting license
    }
}

License license = new License();
license.SetLicense("path/to/your/license/file.lic");

// Basic setup
using (Converter converter = new Converter("input.xlsm"))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

## Implementation Guide
Now, let's break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Loading and Converting XLSM to PNG

#### Overview
This feature allows you to convert your XLSM files directly into PNG format. This is useful for sharing data visually or embedding it in reports.

##### Step 1: Load the XLSM File
First, ensure that your file path is correctly specified:

```csharp
string inputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "yourfile.xlsm");
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```

##### Step 2: Set Up Conversion Options
Define the conversion options to specify that you want a PNG output:

```csharp
var convertOptions = new ImageConvertOptions
{
    Format = ImageFileType.Png // Set the output format as PNG
};
```

##### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output:

```csharp
string outputFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "output.png");
converter.Convert(outputFilePath, convertOptions);
```

### Parameters and Method Purposes
- `Converter`: Loads your XLSM file.
- `ImageConvertOptions`: Configures the output format.
- `Convert()`: Executes the conversion process.

### Troubleshooting Tips
