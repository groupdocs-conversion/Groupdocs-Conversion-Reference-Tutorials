}
```

## Implementation Guide

Now, let's break down the implementation into manageable sections.

### Load and Convert TEX File to PNG
This feature demonstrates how to load a TEX file and convert it into a PNG format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

#### Set Up Output Directory and File Template Path
First, define where your converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.png");

// Function to get the stream for each page
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```
#### Load the Source TEX File
Load your TEX file using the `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    // Conversion options will be set in the next step.
}
```
#### Set Convert Options for PNG Format
Configure the conversion settings to output a PNG format:
```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Png };
```
#### Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion process:
```csharp
converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
```
