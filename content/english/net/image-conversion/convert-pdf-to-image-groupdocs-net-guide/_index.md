- Optimize performance when converting documents

Let's explore the prerequisites before we dive into setup and implementation.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this conversion journey, ensure you have:
- **Required Libraries:** GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. Your development environment should support .NET Framework or .NET Core.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** A working C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **Knowledge Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of C# programming and familiarity with file handling in .NET.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET
To begin, install the GroupDocs.Conversion library via NuGet Package Manager or using the .NET CLI.

**NuGet Package Manager Console:**
```shell
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI:**
```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition
To fully leverage GroupDocs.Conversion, consider acquiring a license:
- **Free Trial:** Start with a free trial to explore features.
- **Temporary License:** Request a temporary license for extended testing.
- **Purchase:** For ongoing use, purchase a full license.

### Basic Initialization and Setup
Once installed, initialize the converter in your C# project:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
// Initialize converter with PDF document path
Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_PDF");
```

## Implementation Guide
In this section, we'll walk through setting up advanced conversion options.

### Feature: Advanced Image Conversion Options
This feature enhances your image output by allowing customization of the conversion process extensively.

#### Step 1: Define Output Settings
First, determine where and how each page of the PDF will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Define the output directory path
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.png");

Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = saveContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, saveContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Next, set the desired image format and other conversion properties:
```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions 
{
    Format = ImageFileType.Png, // Set output to PNG
    FlipMode = ImageFlipModes.FlipY, // Apply vertical flip for visual effect
    Brightness = 50, // Adjust brightness level
    Contrast = 50, // Fine-tune contrast
    Gamma = 0.5F, // Correct gamma settings
    Grayscale = true, // Convert to grayscale for a vintage look
    HorizontalResolution = 300, // High resolution in DPI for clarity
    VerticalResolution = 100 // Standard vertical resolution
};
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Finally, execute the conversion using your configured options:
```csharp
converter.Convert(getPageStream, options); // Convert and save each page as an image
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Libraries:** Ensure all packages are correctly installed via NuGet.
- **File Path Issues:** Double-check directory paths for both input PDFs and output images.

## Practical Applications
Here are some real-world scenarios where converting PDFs to images can be beneficial:
1. **Archiving:** Store documents in a more compact, visually accessible format.
2. **Digital Marketing:** Use high-quality images from your PDF brochures or reports in campaigns.
3. **Document Management Systems:** Enhance searchability and usability by converting text-heavy PDFs into image files.

## Performance Considerations
To ensure smooth conversions:
