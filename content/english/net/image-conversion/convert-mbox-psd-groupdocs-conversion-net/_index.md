### License Acquisition
GroupDocs offers different licensing options:

- **Free Trial:** Access basic functionalities to test the library.
- **Temporary License:** Obtain a temporary license for full-feature access during evaluation.
- **Purchase:** For long-term use, consider purchasing a license.

## Implementation Guide
### Feature: Load MBOX File
#### Overview
Loading an MBOX file is the first step in our conversion process. This feature demonstrates how to load your email archive using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

**Step 1:** Initialize the Converter Object
First, create a `Converter` object by specifying the path of your MBOX file. This prepares the file for subsequent conversion operations.

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string mboxFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.mbox"; // Replace with your actual MBOX file path

// Create a Converter object to load the source MBOX file
using (Converter converter = new Converter(mboxFilePath))
{
    // The MBOX file is now loaded and ready for conversion operations
}
```

**Explanation:** This snippet creates a `Converter` instance, which reads the MBOX file from the specified path. At this stage, your file is ready to be converted into different formats.

### Feature: Convert MBOX to PSD Format
#### Overview
Now that we have our MBOX file loaded, let's convert it into PSD format—a popular graphic design format.

**Step 2:** Define Output Path and Conversion Options
Specify where the converted files will be saved and set up the conversion options for PSD.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Specify the directory where converted files will be saved
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");

// Define a function to get page stream for each conversion result
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);

using (Converter converter = new Converter(mboxFilePath)) // Load the previously loaded MBOX file
{
    // Set convert options for PSD format
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };

    // Perform conversion from MBOX to PSD format
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

**Explanation:** This code snippet sets the output directory and defines how each page of the converted file will be saved. The `ImageConvertOptions` is configured for PSD format, ensuring that your emails are transformed into high-quality graphics.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors:** Double-check the paths specified in your code to ensure they exist.
- **Library Version Mismatch:** Verify that you're using version 25.3.0 of GroupDocs.Conversion as required.
- **Conversion Failures:** Ensure your environment has sufficient permissions and resources for file I/O operations.
