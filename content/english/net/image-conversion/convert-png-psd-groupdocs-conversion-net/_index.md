# How to Convert PNG to PSD Using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to enhance your document processing capabilities by converting image files from PNG format to PSD? Whether it's for graphics design or maintaining layered editing options, this guide will show you how. We'll explore using the powerful GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library, which makes file conversions seamless and efficient.

With this tutorial, you’ll learn:
- How to set up your environment with GroupDocs.Conversion
- Step-by-step instructions for converting PNG files to PSD format
- Practical use cases where this conversion can be beneficial

Let’s dive into the prerequisites needed before we begin our journey into image file conversion.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:

### Required Libraries and Versions

- **GroupDocs.Conversion**: Version 25.3.0 or later
- .NET Framework (4.6.1 or higher) or .NET Core

### Environment Setup Requirements

You'll need a development environment set up with either Visual Studio or another compatible IDE.

### Knowledge Prerequisites

A basic understanding of C# and familiarity with file I/O operations in .NET will be helpful.

## Setting Up GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET

To begin using GroupDocs.Conversion, you first need to install it. Here are two ways to do so:

**NuGet Package Manager Console**

```bash
Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion -Version 25.3.0
```

**.NET CLI**

```bash
dotnet add package GroupDocs.Conversion --version 25.3.0
```

### License Acquisition Steps

- **Free Trial**: Start with a free trial to test out the features.
- **Temporary License**: Obtain a temporary license for extended access without limitations.
- **Purchase**: For ongoing projects, consider purchasing a subscription.

#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Here's how you initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# application:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string licensePath = "path/to/license.lic";
        License license = new License();
        license.SetLicense(licensePath);

        // Your code here
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

Let's break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Feature: Conversion of PNG to PSD

This feature allows you to convert a PNG file into the PSD format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Overview

You'll learn how to set up your environment, create necessary streams for output files, and perform the actual conversion.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

**1. Setting Up Output Directory**

Define where your converted files will be saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\"; // Set your desired output directory here
```

**2. Loading Input File**

Specify the path to your input PNG file:

```csharp
string inputFile = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.png"; // Path to the input PNG file
```

**3. Creating a Stream for Each Page Being Converted**

This function generates a stream for each converted page, ensuring proper file handling:

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(Path.Combine(outputFolder, $"converted-page-{savePageContext.Page}.psd"), FileMode.Create);
```

**4. Loading the Source PNG File and Configuring Conversion Options**

Initialize the converter and set up conversion settings:

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(inputFile))
{
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Psd };

    // Perform the conversion from PNG to PSD format.
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

#### Explanation of Code

- **SavePageContext**: Provides context for each page being converted.
- **ImageConvertOptions**: Configures settings specific to image formats.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure file paths are correctly specified and accessible.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library is properly installed and licensed.

## Practical Applications
