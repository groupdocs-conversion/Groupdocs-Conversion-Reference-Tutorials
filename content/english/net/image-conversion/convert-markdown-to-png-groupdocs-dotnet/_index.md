}
```

This snippet demonstrates the initialization process, which is crucial for starting any conversion task.

## Implementation Guide

Now let’s break down the implementation into manageable sections:

### Loading and Converting Markdown to PNG

#### Overview
This section focuses on converting a Markdown file into a series of PNG images, one page at a time.

#### Step 1: Define Output Settings

Set up your output folder and naming template for the converted files:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.png");
```

#### Step 2: Create FileStream Function

Implement a function to create a `FileStream` for each page of your Markdown file:

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options

Set the conversion options to specify the output format as PNG:

```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Png };
```

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion

Execute the conversion using the `Converter` object:

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.md"))
{
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Errors**: Ensure your file paths are correct and accessible.
- **Memory Management**: Dispose of FileStreams properly to avoid memory leaks.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world use cases for converting Markdown to PNG:
1. **Documentation**: Create shareable snapshots of documentation pages.
2. **Presentations**: Enhance slideshows with converted images from Markdown files.
3. **Web Content**: Use PNG images on websites where Markdown is stored as content.
