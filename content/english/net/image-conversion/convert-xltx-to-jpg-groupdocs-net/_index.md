### Basic Initialization and Setup with C#
```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Initialize the converter
string filePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_XLTX";
using (Converter converter = new Converter(filePath))
{
    // Conversion options will be defined in subsequent steps.
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load and Convert XLTX File to JPG
This feature converts an XLTX file into a series of JPG images, perfect for sharing spreadsheet data visually.

**Step 1: Set the Output Directory Path**
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
// Define where your converted files will be saved.
```

**Step 2: Define the Template for Output File Names**
```csharp
string outputFileTemplate = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");
// This template helps in naming each page of the document with a unique number.
```

**Step 3: Create a Stream for Each Page of the Conversion Result**
```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, System.IO.Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => new System.IO.FileStream(System.String.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), System.IO.FileMode.Create);
// This function ensures each page is saved as a separate file.
```

**Step 4: Load the Source XLTX File and Set Conversion Options**
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(filePath))
{
    // Define conversion options for JPG format
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Jpg };

    // Perform the conversion from XLTX to JPG
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

## Practical Applications
1. **Marketing and Presentations**: Convert data-heavy spreadsheets into visually appealing images for presentations.
2. **Archival Purposes**: Store spreadsheet templates as images in digital archives.
3. **Web Integration**: Use the converted images on websites where users cannot interact with Excel files directly.
