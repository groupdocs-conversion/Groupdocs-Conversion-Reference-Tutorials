## Implementation Guide

### Conversion Feature: LOG to PSD

This feature illustrates how to convert a LOG file into Adobe Photoshop Document format. Let's break down the implementation steps.

#### Step 1: Define Output Directory and Template

Set up your output directory and template for naming converted files:

```csharp
string outputFolder = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
```

#### Step 2: Generate File Streams for Each Page

Create a function to manage file streams for each page in the PSD format:

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 3: Load and Convert LOG File

Use GroupDocs.Conversion to load your source LOG file and convert it to PSD format:

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(@"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.log"))
{
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
    
    // Perform the conversion using the specified stream function and options
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

#### Key Configuration Options

- **ImageConvertOptions**: Set the target format to PSD.
- **Stream Functionality**: Allows for dynamic file handling per page.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure all paths are correctly defined and accessible.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and referenced in your project.
- For large files, consider optimizing memory usage by adjusting buffer sizes.
