    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string documentDirectory = @"YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY";
            string outputDirectory = @"YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";

            using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mhtml")))
            {
                var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg };
                converter.Convert(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mhtml-converted-to.svg"), options);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert MHTML to SVG

This feature allows you to convert an MHTML file into SVG format easily. Let's break it down:

#### Load the Source MHTML File
First, initialize the `Converter` class with your source MHTML file path.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(Path.Combine(documentDirectory, "sample.mhtml")))
```

**Why**: This step is crucial for specifying the input file that will be converted.

#### Define Conversion Options
Set up conversion options to specify SVG as the output format.

```csharp
var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg };
```

**Why**: This configuration ensures the output format is correctly set to SVG, providing flexibility in how you handle graphics on web platforms.

#### Convert and Save the Output File
Finally, perform the conversion and save the resulting file.

```csharp
csvConverter.Convert(Path.Combine(outputDirectory, "mhtml-converted-to.svg"), options);
```

**Why**: This step writes the converted SVG to your desired location, making it ready for use in your projects.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correctly specified.
- Verify that the GroupDocs.Conversion library version matches the code's requirements.

## Practical Applications

Here are some real-world applications of converting MHTML to SVG:
1. **Web Development**: Enhance compatibility by using SVG for vector graphics in web apps.
