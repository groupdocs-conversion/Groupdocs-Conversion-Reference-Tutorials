## Implementation Guide

### Convert PPSX File into SVG Format

#### Overview
Converting a .ppsx file to SVG format involves loading the source file, configuring conversion settings, and saving the output. This section guides you through each step with detailed explanations and code snippets.

#### Step 1: Define Paths for Input/Output Directories
Begin by specifying where your input files are located and where you want the converted files saved:

```csharp
string documentPath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.ppsx");
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "ppsx-converted-to.svg");
```

#### Step 2: Load the Source PPSX File
Load your .ppsx file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class:

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Conversion logic will go here
}
```
This step ensures that your file is ready for processing.

#### Step 3: Configure Conversion Options
Set up the conversion options to specify SVG as the output format:

```csharp
var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg };
```
These options dictate how the conversion process should be handled.

#### Step 4: Perform the Conversion and Save
Execute the conversion and save the resulting SVG file:

```csharp
csvr.Convert(outputFile, options);
```
This command converts your presentation into an SVG file and saves it to the designated location.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly specified to avoid `FileNotFoundException`.
- Verify that you have adequate permissions for reading/writing files.
- If encountering conversion errors, check if the GroupDocs.Conversion version is compatible with your .NET framework.
