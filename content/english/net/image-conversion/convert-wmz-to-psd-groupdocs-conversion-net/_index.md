### Basic Initialization

Here's how to initialize and set up GroupDocs.Conversion in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Initialize the conversion handler with the path to your license file
        using (Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_LICENSE_PATH"))
        {
            // Your code for conversion goes here
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Convert WMZ to PSD

This feature demonstrates converting a WMZ file into an Adobe Photoshop Document. Let's break it down step-by-step.

#### Step 1: Define Output Path and File Template

Start by specifying the output directory where your converted files will be saved:

```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY"; // Define the output directory path
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");
```

#### Step 2: Create a Stream for Each Page

Define a function that creates a new file stream for each page being converted:

```csharp
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext =>
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 3: Load and Convert the WMZ File

Now, load your source WMZ file using the `Converter` class and specify conversion options:

```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/SAMPLE_WMZ")) // Specify your document directory here
{
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd };
    
    // Perform the conversion from WMZ to PSD using the specified stream and options
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

**Key Parameters Explained:**
- `outputFileTemplate`: Template for naming output files.
- `getPageStream`: Function to handle file creation per page.
- `ImageConvertOptions`: Specifies that the target format is PSD.

#### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure your output directory path is correct and writable.
- Verify that WMZ files are not corrupted before conversion.
- Check GroupDocs license validity if encountering usage limitations.

## Practical Applications

GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET offers versatile integration possibilities. Here are some real-world applications:

1. **Graphic Design:** Convert WMZ graphics into PSD format for further editing in Adobe Photoshop.
2. **Automated Workflows:** Integrate conversion processes within automated publishing or document management systems.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Seamlessly convert files across different platforms and software ecosystems.

## Performance Considerations

Optimizing performance is crucial when handling file conversions:

- **Resource Usage Guidelines:** Monitor memory usage during large batch conversions to prevent crashes.
- **Best Practices for .NET Memory Management:**
  - Use `using` statements to ensure proper disposal of resources.
  - Optimize stream operations by using asynchronous methods where applicable.

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a solid understanding of how to convert WMZ files to PSD using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. This guide has covered the necessary setup steps, provided a detailed implementation walkthrough, and highlighted practical applications along with performance tips.
