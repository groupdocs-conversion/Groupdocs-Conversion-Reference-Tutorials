            Console.WriteLine("Conversion setup complete.");
        }
    }
}
```

With your environment ready, let's move on to implementing the conversion process.

## Implementation Guide

In this section, we will cover how to convert RTF files into SVG format using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET.

### Overview of the Feature

This feature demonstrates converting an RTF document to SVG format, leveraging the power and flexibility of GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step 1: Define File Paths

Start by defining the input and output file paths. This ensures your conversion process knows where to read from and save to.

```csharp
string inputRtfFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.rtf");
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY", "converted_files");

// Ensure the output directory exists
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputFolder);

string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "rtf-converted-to.svg");
```

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options

GroupDocs.Conversion provides various options for different file formats. Here, we'll specify that we want to convert our document into SVG format.

```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg };
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion

Now, use the `Converter` object to execute the conversion and save the output file.

```csharp
using (var converter = new Converter(inputRtfFilePath))
{
    // Convert and save the SVG file
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
Console.WriteLine("Conversion completed successfully.");
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **File Path Issues**: Ensure all paths are correctly defined and accessible.
- **Library Version Conflicts**: Verify you’re using the correct version of GroupDocs.Conversion.
- **License Activation**: If experiencing limitations, check your license activation.
