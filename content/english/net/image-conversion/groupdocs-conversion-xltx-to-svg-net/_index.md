## Implementation Guide
### Convert XLTX to SVG with Ease
This feature allows you to convert Excel template files (XLTX) into scalable vector graphics (SVG), making them suitable for web applications.

#### Step 1: Load the Source File
Begin by loading your source XLTX file. Ensure the path is correctly specified:

```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.xltx");
```

*Why*: Specifying the correct path ensures that the converter can locate and read your template.

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Set up conversion options to specify the output format as SVG:

```csharp
var options = new PageDescriptionLanguageConvertOptions
{
    Format = PageDescriptionLanguageFileType.Svg
};
```

*Why*: This step configures the converter to process and generate files in the desired SVG format.

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Execute the conversion and save the output file:

```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFile = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "xltx-converted-to.svg");

using (var converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    converter.Convert(outputFile, options);
}
```

*Why*: This performs the actual conversion process and ensures that your SVG file is stored in the specified directory.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- **Missing Files**: Ensure source paths are correct.
- **Permission Issues**: Check folder permissions for read/write access.
- **Library Version Mismatch**: Verify that you're using compatible library versions.

## Practical Applications
1. **Web Development**: Use SVGs generated from templates to enhance website graphics.
2. **Data Visualization**: Convert data-driven XLTX files into interactive SVG charts.
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Ensure consistent display of documents across different platforms and devices.
