## Implementation Guide

We'll walk through each step needed to convert a DOCX file into JPG format using GroupDocs.Conversion.

### Load Source DOCX File

**Overview:**
Loading your source DOCX file is the first step in any conversion process. This ensures that you have the document ready for transformation into different formats.

**Initialize Converter Object:**

```csharp
// Ensure to include necessary namespaces
using System;
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY\sample.docx";
Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath);
```
- **Parameters:** `documentPath` is the file path of your DOCX.
- **Purpose:** This creates an instance of the `Converter`, which facilitates the conversion process.

### Convert DOCX to JPG Format

**Overview:**
Now that we have our document loaded, let's set up the conversion options and execute the transformation into JPG format.

**Define Output Parameters:**

```csharp
using System.IO;
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");

Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```
- **Purpose:** This defines where and how each page of the document will be saved as a JPG file.
  
**Set Convert Options:**

```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg };
