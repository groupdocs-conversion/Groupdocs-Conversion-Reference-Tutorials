## Implementation Guide
Now, let’s break down the conversion process into manageable steps.

### Load Source TXT File
**Overview:** This feature demonstrates loading a source TXT file using GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET. It's your first step toward converting documents.

#### Initialize Converter
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/Sample.txt";

using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // Ready to perform conversions.
}
```
- **Parameters & Methods:** The `Converter` class is initialized with the path of your TXT file. This sets up the environment for subsequent conversion operations.

### Convert TXT to JPG Format
**Overview:** Convert your text document into a series of JPG images, each representing a page in the original document.

#### Set Conversion Options
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.jpg");

Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);

using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Jpg };
    
    // Perform the conversion
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```
