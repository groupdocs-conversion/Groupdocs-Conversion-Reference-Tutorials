    // Ready to perform conversions
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Feature 1: Load PPTX File

**Overview:** Begin by loading your source PowerPoint file using GroupDocs.Conversion.

#### Step-by-Step:

**Initialize the Converter**
```csharp
string documentPath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.pptx";
using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    // The PPTX file is now loaded and ready for conversion.
}
```
- **Parameters:** `documentPath` specifies where your PPTX file is located.

### Feature 2: Set Conversion Options for PSD Format

**Overview:** Configure the options to convert the loaded file into a PSD format.

#### Step-by-Step:

**Define ImageConvertOptions**
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions();
options.Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Psd; // Set output as PSD
```
- **Key Configurations:** This specifies that the conversion target format is PSD.

### Feature 3: Define Output Stream Handler

**Overview:** Create a function to handle how each converted page will be saved.

#### Step-by-Step:

**Setup File Output Handling**
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");

Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext =>
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```
- **Purpose:** This function generates a file stream for each page converted to PSD.

### Feature 4: Perform Conversion to PSD Format

**Overview:** Execute the conversion process using the defined options and output handling.

#### Step-by-Step:

**Convert PPTX to PSD**
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(documentPath))
{
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options); // Begin conversion
}
// Each page of your PPTX is now saved as a separate PSD file.
```
- **Conversion Execution:** This final step performs the actual conversion.

## Practical Applications

1. **Graphic Design:** Convert presentations into layers for detailed editing in Photoshop.
2. **Marketing Material:** Transform slideshows into high-resolution images for promotional use.
3. **Archiving Projects:** Store PowerPoint content as image files to ensure long-term accessibility.
4. **Cross-Platform Sharing:** Share presentations with clients who prefer PSD formats.

## Performance Considerations

To optimize performance and resource usage:
