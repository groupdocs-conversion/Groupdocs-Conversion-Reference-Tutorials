#### Basic Initialization and Setup

Once installed, initialize GroupDocs.Conversion in your C# application like this:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion;

// Initialize Converter with a source file path
string sourceFilePath = "YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY/sample.wmz";
using (Converter converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // Conversion logic goes here
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Load WMZ File

**Overview:** Begin by loading the WMZ file to perform conversions.

#### Step 1: Define Source Path
Define where your WMZ file is located:
```csharp
string sourceFilePath = Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.wmz");
```

#### Step 2: Load the File
Load the WMZ file using GroupDocs.Conversion's `Converter` class:
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(sourceFilePath))
{
    // The file is now ready for conversion
}
```

### Convert WMZ to PNG Format

**Overview:** After loading, convert the WMZ file into a series of PNG images.

#### Step 1: Set Up Output Directory and Template
Define where the converted files will be saved:
```csharp
string outputFolder = Path.Combine("YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY");
string outputFileTemplate = Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.png");

Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext => 
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 2: Configure Conversion Options
Set options for converting to PNG format:
```csharp
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = GroupDocs.Conversion.FileTypes.ImageFileType.Png };
```

#### Step 3: Perform Conversion
Execute the conversion and save each page as a separate PNG file:
```csharp
using (Converter converter = new Converter(Path.Combine("YOUR_DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY", "sample.wmz")))
{
    converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
}
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all paths are correctly specified.
- Verify GroupDocs.Conversion is properly installed and referenced in your project.
