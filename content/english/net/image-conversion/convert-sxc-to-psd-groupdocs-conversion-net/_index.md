## Implementation Guide

### Overview of SXC to PSD Conversion
This feature allows you to convert spreadsheet data into a format suitable for graphic design software, enabling seamless integration between data analysis and visual presentation.

#### Step 1: Define Output Configuration
Create an output directory path and define a template for naming the converted files. This ensures each page is stored correctly:
```csharp
string outputFolder = "YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY";
string outputFileTemplate = System.IO.Path.Combine(outputFolder, "converted-page-{0}.psd");

// Function to generate a stream for each converted page.
Func<SavePageContext, Stream> getPageStream = savePageContext =>
    new FileStream(string.Format(outputFileTemplate, savePageContext.Page), FileMode.Create);
```

#### Step 2: Set Conversion Options
Configure the conversion settings specific to PSD format:
```csharp
using GroupDocs.Conversion.Options.Convert;

// Define image conversion options for PSD.
ImageConvertOptions options = new ImageConvertOptions { Format = ImageFileType.Psd };
```

#### Step 3: Perform the Conversion
Invoke the `Convert` method on your `Converter` object, passing in the stream function and conversion options:
```csharp
converter.Convert(getPageStream, options);
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure paths are correctly set to avoid file not found errors.
- Verify that GroupDocs.Conversion is properly licensed for full functionality.
